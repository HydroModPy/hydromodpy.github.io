Simulation Workflow
===================

``[workflow].mode = "simulation"`` runs one forward model. It turns one validated
configuration into one persisted run with solver outputs, catalog rows, result
stores, and optional figures.

Use it when the question is:
"Given this physical setup, what does one model run produce?"

Functional Role
---------------

The simulation workflow is the canonical HydroModPy forward run. It usually
performs these phases:

.. code-block:: text

   resolve workspace
       -> build geographic context
       -> load requested data
       -> build supports and mesh input
       -> build process plan
       -> run solver backend(s)
       -> ingest outputs
       -> render figures
       -> finalize catalog and result store

It is appropriate for:

- one MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW 6, or Boussinesq run;
- steady or transient flow simulations;
- solver-specific option testing;
- producing persisted results for later inspection or comparison.

It is not the right first choice when the watershed geometry is still
uncertain. Run ``overview`` first in that case.

Typical Command
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run examples/projects/06_vire_selune/run_vire_mf6_irregular.toml

Reference examples:

- ``examples/projects/00_getting_started/project.toml``
- ``examples/projects/02_nancon_watershed/run_transient_nwt.toml``
- ``examples/projects/06_vire_selune/run_vire_mf6_irregular.toml``
- ``examples/projects/06_vire_selune/run_vire_nwt.toml``
- ``examples/projects/09_comparison_workflow/base_dupuit_shared_mesh.toml``

The figures below use the committed gallery case
``headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference``. It is a more complete
transient MODFLOW 6 example than a minimal launcher run: it combines a natural
headwater support, a transient recharge chronology, integrated discharge
response, and water-table diagnostics.

Representative Results
----------------------

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference_support_overview.png
   :alt: Support overview for a 100 km2 transient MODFLOW 6 simulation
   :width: 100%

   The support overview shows the spatial support that the solver actually
   used: watershed, outlet, hydrographic context, and discretization footprint.
   This is the first figure to inspect when a simulation result looks
   suspicious, because many numerical symptoms start as support-definition
   errors.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference_flow_state_triptych.png
   :alt: Flow-state triptych for a 100 km2 transient MODFLOW 6 simulation
   :width: 100%

   The triptych is the main state diagnostic for one forward run. It puts the
   spatial response, active domain, and hydraulic state side by side so that
   the user can read the simulated behaviour before moving to budgets or
   downstream analytics.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference_recharge_discharge_cumulative.png
   :alt: Cumulative recharge and discharge for a transient MODFLOW 6 simulation
   :width: 100%

   The cumulative recharge/discharge curve checks whether the transient
   forcing chronology produces a plausible integrated hydraulic response. It
   is a compact mass-balance diagnostic, not only a pretty hydrograph.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference_watertable_elevation.png
   :alt: Water-table elevation map for a transient MODFLOW 6 simulation
   :width: 100%

   Water-table elevation makes the hydraulic gradient visible in physical
   coordinates. Use it to check whether the simulated heads are consistent
   with terrain, outlet position, and expected flow direction.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/headwater_100km2_outlet_2_mf6_transient_reference_watertable_depth.png
   :alt: Water-table depth map for a transient MODFLOW 6 simulation
   :width: 100%

   Water-table depth is often the more operational view: it shows where the
   simulated aquifer is near the surface or deep below ground, which is useful
   for diagnosing dry cells, drainage assumptions, and recharge sensitivity.

Minimal Shape
-------------

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "simulation"

   [workspace]
   project_root = "outputs/my_run"

   [simulation]
   name = "my_first_forward_run"

   [simulation.time]
   start_datetime = "2020-01-01 00:00:00"
   end_datetime = "2020-12-31 00:00:00"
   step_value = "1 month"

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "flow_main"
   type = "flow"
   solvers = ["modflow6"]

   [solver]
   backend = { backend = "modflow6" }

Important Parameters
--------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 32 40

   * - Section / field
     - Role
     - Practical guidance
   * - ``base_config``
     - Inherits a shared project TOML.
     - Use overlays for run-specific solver, time, or outlet changes.
   * - ``workflow``
     - Selects the forward-run launcher.
     - Must be ``"simulation"``.
   * - ``[simulation].name``
     - Human-readable run name and the run's identity in the catalog.
     - Use a short name that encodes basin, solver, and scenario. When empty,
       it is derived from the TOML filename at load time.
   * - ``[simulation].if_exists``
     - Behaviour when a run with the same ``name`` already exists in the
       project.
     - ``version`` (default) mints the next ``stem.vN`` and keeps every run
       addressable; ``replace`` trashes the predecessor (restorable) and
       reuses the name; ``fail`` raises an error.
   * - ``[simulation].tags``
     - Free-text tags attached at registration.
     - Use them to group runs (``paper-fig4``, ``draft``); edit later with
       ``hmp catalog tag``.
   * - ``[simulation.time]``
     - Defines stress-period and forcing alignment.
     - Check start/end dates and ``step_value`` before interpreting transient
       results.
   * - ``[[simulation.process]]``
     - Declares process type and active solvers.
     - Use ``type = "mesh"`` for mesh-only preparation, ``type = "flow"``
       for flow solves, and ``type = "transport"`` for transport solves.
   * - ``[flow]``
     - Declares flow process parameters and boundary conditions.
     - This is where physical assumptions become runtime parameters.
   * - ``[mesh_catchment]``
     - Optional runtime catchment mesh used by solver backends.
     - Include it when MODFLOW 6 or Boussinesq should consume an irregular
       mesh.
   * - Backend sections
     - Tune solver-specific behavior.
     - Use ``[modflow6.*]`` or ``[modflownwt.*]`` only for backend-specific
       details.

Time Window Example
-------------------

.. code-block:: toml

   [simulation.time]
   start_datetime = "2000-01-01"
   end_datetime = "2002-12-31"
   step_value = "1 month"
   coverage_policy = "warn"

``coverage_policy = "warn"`` is useful while preparing data because it surfaces
forcing gaps without immediately blocking exploratory runs. Use ``"error"``
for production runs when forcing coverage must be complete.

Process Example
---------------

.. code-block:: toml

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "flow_main"
   type = "flow"
   solvers = ["modflow6"]

The process declaration says what HydroModPy is asked to solve. The backend
sections say how a given solver family should solve it.

Mesh-only preparation is also represented as a simulation process, not as a
solver:

.. code-block:: toml

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "mesh_main"
   type = "mesh"
   backend = "catchment"

This delegates to the ``[mesh_catchment]`` runtime and stops before any flow
or transport solver.

Outputs To Inspect
------------------

After a successful run, inspect in this order:

1. the catalog entry and run metadata;
2. solver logs and convergence messages;
3. support or mesh overview figure;
4. water-table maps and time-series outputs;
5. budget or recharge/discharge figures;
6. persisted Zarr or exported result tables if downstream analysis needs them.
