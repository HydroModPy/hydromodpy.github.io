Results and Exports
===================

HydroModPy V1 writes durable results at the project level. Each project
holds its own DuckDB catalog with simulation metadata, metrics,
parameters, budgets, provenance, and lookup tables. Per-run Zarr and
Parquet stores hold the field arrays, meshes, rasters, timeseries, and
derived arrays.

There is **one simulation catalog per project**, not one DuckDB per
simulation. A simulation receives one row in that project catalog and
its heavy payloads live beside it under ``simulations/``:

- ``catalog.duckdb``: project-level index, metadata, metrics, parameters,
  provenance, calibration traces, workflow ledger, and SQL views.
- ``simulations/<basename>.zarr`` or ``.zarr.zip``: per-simulation arrays,
  mesh, spatial fields, topography rasters, and forcings.
- ``simulations/<basename>.parquet/*.parquet``: per-simulation tabular
  payloads (timeseries, budgets, mass balance), exposed as DuckDB views.

``<basename>`` is normally ``<project>__<name>__<shortuuid>``. Older
workspaces may still use the full raw ``sim_id`` on disk; they remain readable.

Result Store Map
----------------

.. figure:: /_static/concepts/results/workspace_results_exports.svg
   :alt: Map of the HydroModPy workspace result model and export paths
   :width: 100%

   Read the result system in three layers: the workspace catalog records
   metadata and tabular diagnostics, each run store carries arrays and spatial
   objects, and the reading/export APIs convert those objects into tables,
   scientific files, figures, or portable packages.

Core objects
------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 76

   * - Object
     - Role
   * - ``SimulationCatalog``
     - Project-level registry opened by ``hydromodpy.open(project_path)``.
       It owns the single ``catalog.duckdb`` file for the project.
   * - ``Run``
     - One persisted simulation resolved from the catalog. It reads one
       catalog row plus that simulation's Zarr/Parquet artefacts.
   * - ``SimulationGroup``
     - A set of runs used for comparison, calibration, or testbed analysis.
   * - ``ResultsConfig``
     - Configuration block controlling result persistence and export options.

CLI reading path
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp catalog ls
   hmp catalog ls --project my_basin
   hmp catalog show <sim_id>
   hmp catalog show <sim_id> --detail
   hmp best my_basin --metric nse
   hmp worst my_basin --metric nse
   hmp report compare <sim_a> <sim_b>
   hmp viz show <sim_id> <figure>

``sim_id`` accepts a unique prefix. Use ``hmp catalog show --detail`` when you
need file and store details (mesh, Zarr layout), and the plain
``hmp catalog show`` when you need metadata, metrics, or parameters.

Python reading path
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import hydromodpy as hmp

   catalog = hmp.open("~/ws/projects/my_basin")
   run = catalog.latest()
   head0 = hmp.read(run, "head", timestep=0)
   budget = catalog.query_budget(run.sim_id)
   catalog.export(run.sim_id, "head", "netcdf", "run_outputs/head.nc")

Common catalog operations include listing simulations, resolving ids, finding
the latest or best run, querying fields and timeseries, reading budget and
mass-balance records, exporting portable packages, and importing a package into
another workspace.

Query cookbook
--------------

List completed runs for one project:

.. code-block:: python

   import hydromodpy as hmp

   catalog = hmp.open("~/ws/projects/my_basin")
   runs = catalog.list_simulations(
       status="completed",
       order_by="created_at DESC",
   )

Resolve a run id prefix, then open the ``Run`` view:

.. code-block:: python

   sim_id = catalog.resolve("ab12")
   run = catalog[sim_id]

Read a field through the V1 facade (dispatches to Zarr or Parquet via
the field registry):

.. code-block:: python

   run = catalog[sim_id]
   head = hmp.read(run, "head", timestep=0)
   seepage = hmp.read(run, "seepage", timestep=-1)

Read station time series:

.. code-block:: python

   q = catalog.query_timeseries(
       sim_id,
       station_id="J1234010",
       variable="discharge",
       period=("2000-01-01", "2005-12-31"),
   )

Read budgets, mass balance, and provenance:

.. code-block:: python

   budgets = catalog.query_budget(sim_id)
   outlet_budget = catalog.query_budget(sim_id, zone_id="outlet")
   mass_balance = catalog.query_mass_balance(sim_id)
   provenance = catalog.get_provenance(sim_id)

Use SQL when you need a cross-run table:

.. code-block:: python

   ranking = catalog.sql(
       """
       SELECT s.project, s.name, m.metric_name, m.value
         FROM simulations s
         JOIN metrics m ON s.sim_id = m.sim_id
        WHERE s.status = 'completed'
          AND m.metric_name = ?
        ORDER BY m.value DESC
       """,
       ["nse"],
   )

Export cookbook
---------------

Export all persisted timeseries to CSV:

.. code-block:: python

   catalog.export(run.sim_id, "*", "csv", "exports/timeseries.csv")

Export one field to common external formats:

.. code-block:: python

   catalog.export(run.sim_id, "head", "netcdf", "exports/head.nc")
   catalog.export(run.sim_id, "head", "geotiff", "exports/head_last.tif", timestep=-1)
   catalog.export(run.sim_id, "head", "vtu", "exports/head_last.vtu", timestep=-1)

Package a full run for exchange:

.. code-block:: python

   catalog.export_package(run.sim_id, "exports/my_run.hmp")
   catalog.import_package("exports/my_run.hmp")

Temporal conventions in CSV exports
-----------------------------------

Comparison CSV files distinguish state snapshots from period values explicitly.
Use the ``time_role`` column before interpreting ``time_index`` or
``elapsed_seconds``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 76

   * - ``time_role``
     - Meaning
   * - ``initial_state``
     - Explicit state before the first transient period. It is useful for
       initial-condition diagnostics, but it is not a budget period.
   * - ``state_snapshot``
     - Instantaneous model state at the reported elapsed time, for example a
       hydraulic-head or watertable map.
   * - ``period_value``
     - Value associated with a completed period. Budget tables also provide
       ``period_index``, ``period_start_seconds``, and
       ``period_end_seconds``.
   * - ``reduced``
     - Row obtained by reducing several time rows, for example with a mean,
       min, max, or sum reducer.

For budgets, ``elapsed_seconds`` is the period end time. Do not compare a
``period_value`` row to an ``initial_state`` row. Boussinesq histories may store
an explicit initial state at ``t = 0``; comparison budget exports skip that row
instead of treating it as a zero-duration budget.

Comparison metrics also enforce this distinction: fallback matching can align
equivalent elapsed times or equivalent non-initial order positions, but it must
not compare rows with different ``time_role`` values. For explicit state
selection, prefer ``time = "initial_state"`` when the initial condition itself
is the target, and ``time = "first_computed"`` when the first transient result
is the target. The legacy ``time = "first"`` selector means "first available
row" and is therefore ambiguous when one solver exports an initial state and
another starts at the first computed step.

Package exchange
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp export <sim_id> -o my_run.hmp
   hmp add my_run.hmp
   hmp add my_run.hmp --dry-run

Use ``.hmp`` packages for reproducible handoff between workspaces. Use format
exports when the next consumer is GIS, ParaView, a notebook, or an external
analysis tool.
