Calibration Workflow
====================

``[workflow].mode = "calibration"`` runs a parameter-estimation campaign. Instead of
executing one fixed simulation, HydroModPy repeatedly proposes parameter
values, runs candidate simulations, scores them, and records the calibration
history.

Use it when the question is:
"Which parameter values best explain the observations or synthetic targets?"

Functional Role
---------------

The calibration workflow sits on top of the simulation workflow:

.. code-block:: text

   base configuration
       -> prepare reusable context
       -> ask optimizer for parameters
       -> inject parameter values
       -> run candidate simulation
       -> extract observable(s)
       -> compute objective
       -> tell optimizer result
       -> persist calibration history
       -> optionally promote best runs

It is appropriate for:

- estimating hydraulic conductivity, storage, boundary conductance, or other
  exposed model parameters;
- comparing optimization methods;
- twin experiments with synthetic observations;
- calibration diagnostics and reporting.

Typical Command
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run examples/projects/02_nancon_watershed/run_calibration_k.toml

Reference examples:

- ``examples/projects/01_calibration/project.toml``
- ``examples/projects/02_nancon_watershed/run_calibration_k.toml``
- calibration pages under :doc:`../../capability_gallery/calibration`

Representative Results
----------------------

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/calibration/calibration_twin_dupuit_fixed_head_posterior_modflow6__configuration.png
   :alt: Calibration configuration figure
   :width: 100%

   The configuration figure makes the inverse problem explicit: calibrated
   parameters, outputs, objective blocks, methods, and noise assumptions all
   stay visible in one panel.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/calibration/calibration_twin_dupuit_fixed_head_posterior_modflow6__da_mh_gp_landscape.png
   :alt: Calibration objective landscape for a distribution-valued method
   :width: 100%

   The objective landscape or pairwise projection shows where the evaluated
   candidates concentrate relative to the truth and the selected solution.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/calibration/calibration_twin_dupuit_fixed_head_posterior_modflow6__da_mh_gp_posterior.png
   :alt: Calibration posterior distribution for a distribution-valued method
   :width: 100%

   ``da_mh_gp`` is currently the built-in method whose result is a parameter
   distribution. Its posterior figure shows the complete retained sample, not
   only the posterior mode or the best-fit candidate.

Pick A Method
-------------

The ``[calibration].method`` field selects the optimizer. ``save_runs``
controls disk cost; ``best_n`` keeps every trial in the DuckDB trace but
only promotes the top trials to full Zarr / Parquet stores.

Important Parameters
--------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 32 40

   * - Section / field
     - Role
     - Practical guidance
   * - ``workflow``
     - Selects the calibration launcher.
     - Must be ``"calibration"``.
   * - ``base_config``
     - Holds the fixed model configuration.
     - Keep geometry, solver family, and non-calibrated parameters in the base
       file.
   * - ``[simulation]``
     - Defines each candidate run window and process.
     - Calibration still needs a valid forward simulation definition.
   * - ``[calibration].method``
     - Selects optimizer or sampler.
     - ``optuna`` is the general default; grid/random/local-simplex/CMA-ES
       variants are useful for controlled benchmarks.
   * - ``max_iter``
     - Number of candidate evaluations.
     - Keep small for smoke tests; increase for production calibration.
   * - ``batch_size``
     - Number of suggestions per ask.
     - Current examples usually use ``1`` for sequential campaigns.
   * - ``save_runs``
     - Controls persistence cost.
     - ``none`` keeps history only, ``best_n`` promotes best candidates,
       ``all`` stores every candidate as a full simulation.
   * - ``objective``
     - Metric optimized by the default objective.
     - Use ``kge`` or ``nse`` for discharge-style calibration, ``rmse`` or
       ``mae`` for scale-dependent errors.
   * - ``[calibration.parameters.*]``
     - Declares bounds, transform, prior, and target config path.
     - The ``path`` must match the runtime configuration field that should be
       overwritten.
   * - ``[calibration.outputs.*]``
     - Optional explicit observable declarations.
     - Use for point, cell, or boundary outputs in richer calibration cases.
   * - ``[[calibration.objective_blocks]]``
     - Optional composite objective blocks.
     - Use when several observables or weighted metrics must be combined.

Parameter Declaration Example
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: toml

   [calibration.parameters.K]
   bounds = [1e-6, 1e-3]
   transform = "log"
   prior = "log_uniform"
   path = "flow.param.K.field.value"
   units = "m/s"

Use ``transform = "log"`` for strictly positive parameters spanning several
orders of magnitude. Use ``mode = "scale"`` only when the sampled value should
multiply an existing baseline rather than replace it.

Persistence Strategy
--------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - ``save_runs``
     - What is stored
     - When to use it
   * - ``none``
     - Calibration history, no full candidate stores.
     - Fast exploratory search.
   * - ``best_n``
     - History plus full outputs for the top ``save_best_n`` candidates.
     - Recommended default for practical calibration.
   * - ``all``
     - Every candidate becomes a full persisted simulation.
     - Debugging, small synthetic benchmarks, or audit-heavy studies.

Where The Calibration Lands
---------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 62

   * - Path
     - Content
   * - ``sessions/<session_name>/session.json``
     - Session descriptor: identity, project, search space, objective,
       dates, best trial. Written before the first trial, rewritten
       with the outcome at the end.
   * - ``sessions/<session_name>/trials.jsonl``
     - Trial log: one JSON object per evaluated trial, appended live.
       An interrupted calibration keeps every trial it evaluated.
   * - ``runs/<run_name>/``
     - One full run directory per promoted trial, when
       ``save_runs = "best_n"`` or ``"all"``.
   * - ``share/reports/<session_name>/report.html``
     - HTML report and its ``figures/`` sub-directory, rendered by
       ``hmp report render``.

The session directory is the source of truth for the history. The
``calibration_sessions`` and ``calibration_iterations`` tables of
``.hmp/index.duckdb`` are an index over those two files and are rebuilt
from them by ``hmp catalog reindex``.

Outputs To Inspect
------------------

After a calibration run, inspect:

1. configuration figure, so the inverse setup is explicit before reading scores;
2. objective history or trace, to see convergence and failed regions;
3. best parameter values;
4. posterior or distribution figure when the method is distribution-valued;
5. objective landscape or pairwise projection, to understand where candidates concentrate;
6. promoted best-run outputs if ``save_runs = "best_n"`` or ``"all"``.
