Calibrating on the stream network
=================================

How to calibrate a catchment against the extent of its hydrographic network
rather than against a gauge, in two stages: the transmissivity-to-recharge
ratio against the network in steady state, then the storage against the
discharge in transient.

Read :doc:`../../theory/streams_and_seepage/downslope-distance-calibration`
first. This page says how to run it; that one says what the number means, and
which way each of its known biases points.

Before you start
----------------

Four things have to be true, and the first is the one people skip.

**The mapped network must sit in the talwegs of the routing surface.** The
criterion measures lengths along the flow paths of the DEM, so if the linework
does not follow them, it measures a disagreement between two datasets. Burn the
network into the routing surface first:

.. code-block:: toml

   [geographic.enforce_streams]
   enabled = true
   stream_geometry_path = "data/hydrography/streams.gpkg"
   mode = "constant"
   depth_m = 30

``stream_geometry_path`` is not optional. Without it the geographic pipeline
stops on ``geographic.enforce_streams.stream_geometry_path is unset.`` at the
first step, before anything is calibrated. The path is anchored once, when
the configuration is loaded: a relative value against the directory of the TOML
that declares it, a bare filename under ``<workspace>/data/hydrography/`` then
``<workspace>/data/``. Nothing is probed when the file is read, so the run
takes the same network whatever directory it was launched from.

A project declaring that path gets the agreement measured whether or not
``enabled`` is set, which is how you find out that the burning is needed. It
goes to ``stream_dem_agreement.json`` in the geographic directory, as
``alpha``: the ratio between the mapped network and its own downslope closure,
where one means the linework follows the talwegs and below 0.90 the run warns.
Redo the burning at every change of resolution: the ratio between the width of
the linework and the cell size changes with it.

**That number is not the one the criterion publishes, and the two cannot
agree.** The burn is cut into the routing DEM alone; the model top stays on the
raw DEM, because a top lowered along the mapped network would give a model that
seeps along it by construction. The criterion measures its distances on that
top, so the ratio it recomputes on the solver mesh and publishes per trial as
``alpha_obs_closure`` describes a different surface. On the Nancon the routing
DEM reaches ``alpha = 0.994`` after a 30 m burn while ``alpha_obs_closure``
sits at 0.306, below the 0.90 threshold, and every trial says so. Read both:
the first says the delineation and the flow paths follow the map, the second
says how much of the criterion's own measurement is a top-versus-map
disagreement.

**The drain conductance must stay proportional to the conductivity.** Leave
``[flow.bc.cauchy.drainage] value`` at zero, or at anything not strictly
positive, so the fallback applies: ``C = K * cell_area / top_thickness`` on both
MODFLOW backends, ``C = K * cell_area`` on Boussinesq. That proportionality is
what makes the ratio the calibrated quantity; a fixed conductance breaks the
invariance from a factor 1.05 onwards.

**The recharge must be frozen during the first stage.** The criterion at one
per cent is on the ratio, which equals one per cent on the conductivity only
when the recharge does not move. Every trial publishes ``R_mean_m_s``, the mean
recharge the criterion actually read back from the built model, and a move
between two builds raises a warning naming both values. Nothing refuses the run,
because this check knows a mesh and not a session: keep the recharge out of
``[calibration.parameters]`` and out of anything the first phase moves, and read
``R_mean_m_s`` across the trials before reading the calibrated value as a ``K``.

**The union has to cover every package that carries water out of the aquifer.**
The criterion reads the per-cell release as the union of the packages that can
feed the surface: drains, streams, release-role constant heads. Whenever the
stream reaches are modelled rather than drained, most of the seepage leaves
through the stream package and not through the drain. Measured on the Nancon
with the main reaches in SFR: the aquifer sent 1.33 of its 2.10 m3/s through
the stream package while 0.80 stayed on the drain. A union reading the drain
alone would report 63 per cent of that water as dry land, exactly where the
package drains, which is exactly where the criterion aims. Both extractors now
read the requirement off the budget file rather than off the model object, and
refuse a release record no declared package covers instead of returning a
partial network.

The visible symptom, if that guard is ever bypassed, is a root that stops
responding to the parameter: on that same run the search closed on a
conductivity three decades above its declared bounds, with a validity indicator
comfortably inside its own. A simulated network holding its cells by
construction never retracts, and the criterion then balances against a fixed
skeleton.

   "simulation.time.step_value"      = 1

Declaring the ``[[calibration.phases]]`` table is what switches the runner to
staged mode. Without it nothing changes for an existing configuration.

What each choice buys you
-------------------------

``method = "bisection"``
   A root search, not a minimiser. The criterion has a zero, not a minimum, and
   the two are not the same point. It stops on the width of the bracket, never
   on the size of the residual: the residual is a step function that jumps over
   zero and may never get small. It searches one parameter, and that parameter
   has to declare ``transform = "log"``: the width it stops on is a width in
   that variable, so on any other transform it would read as an absolute one.
   A two-parameter space and a non-log transform are both refused.

``sweep_points = 7``
   A coarse logarithmic sweep before the bisection. It checks the monotonicity
   the paper assumes rather than supposing it, it sees every crossing, and the
   crossing curves come out of the same solves. Set it to zero for the pure
   bisection of the paper.

``[calibration.phases.overrides]``
   The two stages do not run the same model: the first is steady and reads a
   seepage mask at equilibrium, the second is transient over a span long enough
   to shape the recessions. The flow regime and the simulated period are
   properties of the model rather than of the search, so the phase declares
   them. A phase is refused if it overrides a path another phase freezes, or if
   it rewrites the calibration section under itself.

``points_per_dim`` on a grid phase
   What sets the number of points, not ``max_iter``. The grid adapter defaults
   to five per dimension and ``max_iter`` is only a ceiling, so a phase asking
   for nine trials without this keyword runs five.

``weighting = "area"``
   Recommended as soon as the mesh is refined along the streams, which is the
   usual refinement: an unweighted mean over-samples the river corridor, where
   distances are smallest. Both weightings are always reported, and their gap
   measures that effect directly.

``tau_specific_ratio``
   A cell releasing less than this fraction of its own recharge is not a
   stream. Zero reproduces the criterion of the paper, which gives no threshold
   at all.

   **Leave it at its default, and do not read it as a working knob.** It is
   inert as defined: a cell that releases at all carries the drainage it
   collects from everything upslope, a hundred to a thousand times its own
   recharge, so a fraction of that recharge never excludes anything. Measured on
   the Nancon at the calibrated conductivity, over the 380 cells releasing inside the catchment, not one
   had a flux below the threshold, and raising the ratio to 100 still kept 28.

   Thresholding the total release instead was tried and is worse: at
   ``1e-4`` of ``R * A`` the cut lands at 4.9e-4 m3/s, above the many small
   releases a low conductivity spreads over the catchment and below the few
   large ones a high conductivity concentrates. The simulated network then
   GROWS with the conductivity instead of retracting, the residual loses its
   monotonicity, and the root moves three decades. What the threshold should be
   a fraction of is an open question; neither answer tried so far is right.

``objective = "nse_log"`` in the second stage
   The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency on log-transformed series, which weights the
   recessions. Do not write ``transform = "log"`` for this: that takes the
   logarithm of an already-computed cost and is an unrelated operation.

``variable`` and ``objective`` on the second stage only
   Declaring either one picks the single-metric route for that phase. The
   phase then inherits neither the outputs nor the objective blocks the
   calibration declares, which is what keeps the transient stage off the
   network criterion of the first one. Declaring both conventions on the same
   phase is refused rather than silently resolved.

``scoring_window`` rather than ``warmup_periods``
   A window in dates means the same span whatever the output frequency; a count
   of samples does not. The two are mutually exclusive and declaring both is
   refused.

Running it
----------

.. code-block:: console

   $ hmp calibrate calibration.toml
   $ hmp calibrate calibration.toml --list-phases
   $ hmp calibrate calibration.toml --phase steady_k_over_r

The first form is the one to use. It runs the phases in declaration order and
is the only form that produces the two-stage result the page describes.

``--list-phases`` prints the declared phases and exits without running
anything.

``--phase`` selects a single phase, and it only accepts one that does not
depend on another. On the configuration above that means ``steady_k_over_r``,
and nothing else: ``--phase transient_sy`` is refused, because
``transient_sy`` declares ``depends_on = "steady_k_over_r"`` and a phase whose
dependency did not run in the same invocation is missing the values that
dependency freezes. The runner refuses rather than running it against the
baseline the TOML declares, which would be a different calibration with nothing
in the result to say so. There is no way to hand a frozen value in from a
previous invocation: to run the second stage, run both.

Reading the output
------------------

Every trial writes close to forty diagnostics into ``trials.jsonl`` and into the
iteration table. They are all prefixed with the name of the output that
produced them, so the keys below read ``seepage_network.J_signed``,
``seepage_network.roptim`` and so on in the files. They are written whether or
not a run is promoted; the configuration above promotes one, the best. The ones
to look at first:

``J_signed``
   The signed residual. Its sign says which side of the balance the trial is
   on, and it is what the search brackets. If it never changes sign over the
   sweep, the search widens the interval by a decade on each side, up to
   ``bracket_expand`` times (four by default), then raises and names both ends
   rather than returning the better of the two. One failed evaluation anywhere
   in the sweep skips the widening: the surface is the problem, not the
   interval. A root that only exists outside the declared bounds is returned
   with a warning naming both, because several decades out is usually a
   residual that stopped responding to the parameter rather than a surprising
   value.

``roptim`` and ``roptim_valid``
   The validity indicator of Equation 4, against the ``roptim_max`` bound (two
   by default). It **qualifies** the result and does not withhold it: a
   violation warns and the value comes back, unless you set
   ``on_roptim_violation = "error"``, which raises instead. And it measures
   agreement, not correctness, so do not read it as a quality score of the
   model.

``R_mean_m_s``
   The denominator of the calibrated ratio. It is what makes the result a
   ``K/R`` rather than a ``K``, and comparing it across the trials of a session
   is how you check the first stage really held the recharge still.

``alpha_obs_closure`` and ``frac_reachable_obs_raw``
   How much of the criterion's own measurement is a top-versus-map
   disagreement, and how much of the mapped support has a descent that reaches
   the network at all. ``alpha_obs_closure`` is measured on the model top and
   not on the burned routing DEM, so a low value is not evidence the burning
   was skipped: read it beside the ``alpha`` of the geographic step, as the
   second item of "Before you start" says. They describe the geometry, not the
   trial, so they are identical across a session: the static geometry is
   rebuilt at every trial from the same topography and comes out the same.

``frac_unreachable_so`` and ``frac_unreachable_os``
   The share of each support whose descent ends without meeting its target.
   The bound holds on ``frac_unreachable_so`` alone: its target is the mapped
   network with the outlet sealed in, which does not move between trials, so
   beyond ``max_unreachable_fraction`` (five per cent by default) the trial
   fails loudly, because averaging over a truncated support is a fiction and
   the cells dropped are never a random sample: they sit upstream of a pit.
   ``frac_unreachable_os`` is reported and deliberately unbounded. Its target
   is the SIMULATED network, which the calibration moves: at a high
   conductivity the simulated streams retract into the talwegs and mapped cells
   legitimately have nothing left to descend into. Those cells saturate at
   ``L_cap``, and the value is the signal the search reads at the high end of
   its bracket, not a broken surface.

``D_so_median``, ``D_so_p90``, ``D_so_top5_share``
   The shape of the tail, with ``D_os_median``, ``D_os_p90`` and
   ``D_os_top5_share`` beside them for the other support. The median is usually
   zero and a few long branches carry most of the value, so the mean is not a
   typical gap.

``n_valid``, ``n_excess``, ``n_missing``
   The three-class counts. The criterion balances the last two against each
   other, which is what the confusion map draws.

What it looks like on a real catchment
--------------------------------------

``examples/projects/21_nancon_network_calibration`` runs the configuration
above on the Nancon at Fougeres, 64.68 km2 in Brittany, and its ``README.md``
carries the measured numbers. In short: fifteen trials, a seven-point sweep
across four decades with exactly one sign change, and a root at
:math:`K = 2.103 \times 10^{-4}` m/s where the criterion balances 550 cells of
excess against 517 missing. ``roptim`` comes out at 4.58, above its bound, so
the value is returned qualified. The second stage then pins ``Sy`` on its lower
bound at an ``nse_log`` of -0.001, which is what a stage that identifies
:math:`S_y/T` does when it is handed a biased :math:`T`: it saturates instead
of absorbing.

Two things that example shows and this page cannot: the same catchment
calibrated under both MODFLOW backends, eleven per cent apart on the root; and
the same catchment again with the reaches in SFR, which is what puts the
release union of the previous section under load.

The figures
-----------

Eight figures are registered for this method: ``downslope_distance_crossing``,
``bisection_bracket_trace``, ``parameter_cost_profile``,
``abherve_two_stage_card``, ``seepage_network_reference_overlay``,
``seepage_network_confusion_map``, ``downslope_distance_map`` and
``hydrograph_log_nse``.

All eight are declared, never scripted. List them in ``[display].figures`` of
the project or of the calibration TOML and the promoted run renders them like
any other figure of the gallery:

.. code-block:: toml

   [display]
   figures = [
       "downslope_distance_crossing",
       "bisection_bracket_trace",
       "parameter_cost_profile",
       "seepage_network_reference_overlay",
       "seepage_network_confusion_map",
       "downslope_distance_map",
       "hydrograph_log_nse",
       "abherve_two_stage_card",
   ]

The first four read the trials of the session straight off the run. The three
network maps rebuild the per-cell partition the criterion scored, through the
same construction it used
(:mod:`hydromodpy.core.stream_geometry`, reached from
:func:`hydromodpy.results.derive.stream_network.network_comparison_from_run`),
so a map cannot disagree with the ``n_valid``, ``n_excess`` and ``n_missing``
the trial published. They need three things from the run and say which one is
missing when it is: a per-cell ``release_flux``, a ``reference`` hydrographic
network, and a delineated watershed. The first comes from
``[simulation.results.derived] release_flux = true``, the second from
``[[data.hydrography.sources]]``.

Their knobs go through ``[display.overrides]``, so a reader can move the
threshold the partition depends on, or read the other direction of the
distance, without touching code:

.. code-block:: toml

   [display.overrides.seepage_network_confusion_map]
   tau_specific_ratio = 0.0

   [display.overrides.downslope_distance_map]
   direction = "to_simulated"

A ninth figure, ``roptim_validity_chart``, compares the calibrated agreement of
SEVERAL catchments, and a run holds one. It refuses a run-driven render by name
rather than drawing one point, and it is fed per-site records directly.

``abherve_two_stage_card`` is a grid of panels and draws through ``plot()``,
not through ``render(sim, ax)``.

What to publish
---------------

Publish the ratio, not the conductivity. That advice stands, and it is work you
have to do yourself: the calibration returns the calibrated conductivity raw, in
``best_parameters`` of the report, and it publishes no ratio at all. There is no
``t_over_r``, no ``k_over_r`` and no ``k_optim`` anywhere in the output. Divide
by ``R_mean_m_s``, which every trial publishes, and state the recharge series it
came from beside the number: the conductivity inherits it entirely, and changing
reanalysis moved it by +3, +25 and -28 per cent on the three catchments the
theory page reports.

What the code does publish, and what belongs in the paper beside the value, is
the diagnostic set above: ``D_so`` and ``D_os``, the cost ``J`` with its signed
form ``J_signed``, ``Doptim`` and ``roptim`` with ``roptim_valid``. See the
section on known biases of the theory page before reusing any of them.

And state the density of the mapped network beside the value, because the bias
scales with it. On the Nancon the map is the permanent network alone, 0.70 km
per km2 inside the catchment, and the calibrated conductivity came out 3.3
times the prior the project declares, inside the documented factor of 2.7 to
7.5 for a thinned network.
