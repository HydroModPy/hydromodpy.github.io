Cache And Lockfiles
===================

When a workspace exists, API-backed data is persisted under
``<workspace>/data/<family>/`` and indexed in ``<workspace>/data/cache.duckdb``.
Custom data stays at the path declared by the TOML but can still be indexed or
checked through the data commands.

Cache layout
------------

.. code-block:: text

   <workspace>/
   |-- data/
   |   |-- cache.duckdb
   |   |-- dem/
   |   |-- hydrometry/
   |   |-- piezometry/
   |   `-- recharge/
   `-- hydromodpy.lock

The DuckDB catalog stores variable, source, station id, spatial coverage,
period, unit, source unit, file path, and file modification time. Managers query
this catalog before downloading again.

What cache stability protects
-----------------------------

The cache is not an administrative detail. It protects the data evidence behind
published figures: which stations were found, which time window was loaded, and
which forcing or observation files were reused.

.. figure:: /_static/user_guide/data/provider_gallery_policy_ladder.png
   :alt: Provider replay policy linking cache and lockfiles
   :width: 100%

   Provider-specific pages should show replayable artifacts by default. When a
   live API refresh is needed, the refreshed payload should be cached, locked,
   and only then promoted to a documentation figure.

The documentation hydrography comparison follows the same discipline with a
small explicit refresh script. It writes provider GPKG artifacts plus a JSON
manifest containing feature counts, lengths, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes:

.. code-block:: powershell

   python docs/source/user_guide/data/refresh_hydrography_provider_replays.py --case couesnon --providers bdtopage osm euhydro

The normal figure renderer then reads those files without touching the network.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_identity_card_station_inventory.png
   :alt: Station inventory protected by cache and lockfile discipline
   :width: 100%

   A station inventory should remain stable between a documented run and a
   later frozen replay unless the provider refresh is intentional.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_timeseries_discharge.png
   :alt: Discharge chronicle protected by cache and lockfile discipline
   :width: 100%

   The same applies to observation chronicles. A silently refreshed API result
   can change a comparison even when the solver TOML did not change.

Inspect and repair the cache
----------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp data list --workspace ~/hydromodpy
   hmp data list --workspace ~/hydromodpy --variable hydrometry
   hmp data list --workspace ~/hydromodpy --provider hubeau
   hmp data check --workspace ~/hydromodpy
   hmp data check --workspace ~/hydromodpy --fix

Use cleanup commands deliberately:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp data remove --workspace ~/hydromodpy --variable recharge --provider sim2
   hmp data prune --workspace ~/hydromodpy --older-than 90
   hmp data prune --workspace ~/hydromodpy --older-than 90 --delete-files

``--delete-files`` removes underlying cached files as well as catalog entries.
Without it, the catalog is cleaned but files are left on disk.

Lock the cache
--------------

The lockfile records the file identity of indexed artifacts. Use it after a data
overview run or before archiving a project:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp lock update --workspace ~/hydromodpy
   hmp lock verify --workspace ~/hydromodpy

A frozen run refuses to refresh or ingest unlocked data:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run examples/projects/05_nancon_data_overview/config_overview.toml --frozen

Use frozen mode for CI, teaching material, and any result that must be
replayable without silent downloads.

Archive and restore
-------------------

Two command families can create portable data archives:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp data export --workspace ~/hydromodpy data-cache.tar.gz
   hmp data import --workspace ~/hydromodpy data-cache.tar.gz

   hmp lock archive --workspace ~/hydromodpy locked-data.tar.gz
   hmp lock restore --workspace ~/hydromodpy locked-data.tar.gz

Use ``hmp data export`` when you want a cache archive. Use ``hmp lock archive``
when the lockfile identity is the contract you want to move with the artifacts.

Manual ingestion
----------------

Power users can register one file explicitly:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp data add data/hydrometry/station.csv \
       --workspace ~/hydromodpy \
       --type hydrometry \
       --provider custom \
       --crs EPSG:4326 \
       --unit m3/s \
       --station-id J1234010

Add ``--frozen`` when the file must already match an existing lockfile entry.

Recommended policy
------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 35 40

   * - Situation
     - Policy
     - Commands
   * - Exploration
     - Let API managers populate the cache.
     - ``hmp run ...`` then ``hmp data list``
   * - Reproducible example
     - Lock once the figures and data are accepted.
     - ``hmp lock update`` then ``hmp run --frozen``
   * - Offline validation
     - Restore locked artifacts before running.
     - ``hmp lock restore`` then ``hmp lock verify``
   * - Provider refresh
     - Refresh one source intentionally.
     - Add ``force_refresh = true`` to that source, run, then update the lock.
