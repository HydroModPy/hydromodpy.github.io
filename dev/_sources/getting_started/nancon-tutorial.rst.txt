Nançon Tutorial
================

.. page-badges::
   :difficulty: beginner
   :time: 45 min
   :tags: install, data, transient

This page starts from an empty machine and ends with a complete monthly
transient MODFLOW 6 simulation of the Nançon catchment, GeoTIFF exports
included. It builds the config in five small files, each inheriting from
the previous one through ``base_config``, so you see exactly what each new
section buys you.

.. important::

   Follow this page top to bottom on a machine that has never run
   HydroModPy. If a workspace already exists and you only want one
   end-to-end case, :doc:`simulation-walkthrough` is shorter.

What this tutorial teaches
---------------------------

- Install HydroModPy and fetch the MODFLOW solver binaries.
- Scaffold a workspace and prove it works with the bundled demo before any
  real data is involved.
- Bring one real catchment's configs and data onto your machine with one
  command, and know what it cached and why.
- Build a config from nothing to a monthly transient run with exports,
  through five layered files and the ``base_config`` merge rules.
- Try a variation with ``--overlay`` and ``--set`` instead of writing a
  sixth file.
- Know where calibration and visualization pick up once this page stops.

1. Install HydroModPy
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --pre hydromodpy

``--pre`` is required while HydroModPy is a pre-1.0 release series; see
:doc:`../install` for optional extras and system dependencies.

2. Fetch the MODFLOW solvers
------------------------------

Solver binaries download on first use, but fetching them eagerly makes the
first run below fully offline:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp install-binaries

Running it again is a no-op once the binaries are cached; add ``--upgrade``
to force a re-download.

3. Create a workspace
------------------------

A workspace owns the shared input-data cache and hosts one or more
projects:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp workspace init ~/hydromodpy

It creates:

.. code-block:: text

   ~/hydromodpy/
   ├── workspace.toml   name, contact, licence, geographic scope
   ├── data/            one folder per variable (24 folders), each with a
   │                    README and one example file per accepted format
   └── projects/
       └── example/     a ready-to-run synthetic demo project

4. Run the bundled demo
--------------------------

Before touching any real data, confirm the install works:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run ~/hydromodpy/projects/example/run_demo.toml

This finishes in well under a minute on a cached solver install, and prints
``Run completed: demo [<id>] ...`` on success. If it fails, run
``hmp doctor`` before going further.

5. Get the Nançon example onto your machine
---------------------------------------------

One command fetches the five step configs, the three run variants, the README
and the seven data files they read, and writes them where this workspace
expects them:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp example add 04

It prints what it downloaded and where it wrote it:

.. code-block:: text

   [example add] Downloaded 18 file(s), 92.0 MiB, from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydroModPy/HydroModPy/v2.0.0a1.
   [example add] Workspace: ~/hydromodpy
   [example add] Project:   ~/hydromodpy/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient
   [example add] 18 file(s) written, 0 already up to date.

Look before you fetch, if you like. ``hmp example list`` reads the catalogue
that ships inside the wheel, so it answers offline and tells you how much of
the payload this machine is still missing; ``hmp example show 04`` lists the
18 files one by one, each marked cached or missing:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp example list
   hmp example show 04

Where the files land
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The eleven authored files go into their own project folder, and the seven
data files into the shared ``data/<variable>/`` folders of the workspace,
which is where every project of this workspace reads them from:

.. code-block:: text

   ~/hydromodpy/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── dem/DEM_armorican_massif.tif                                90 MiB
   │   ├── hydrography/nancon_stream_network.gpkg
   │   ├── hydrometry/hydrometry_custom_NANCON_19820201_20220125_D.csv
   │   ├── recharge/recharge_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv
   │   ├── recharge/recharge_custom_NANCON_REA_19900101_20201231_D.csv
   │   ├── runoff/runoff_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv
   │   └── runoff/runoff_custom_NANCON_REA_19900101_20201231_D.csv
   └── projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient/
       ├── README.md
       ├── project.toml  run_daily.toml  run_calibration.toml
       ├── run_calibration_by_hand.toml  run_manual.py
       └── step1_minimal.toml ... step5_export.toml

The 90 MiB DEM is the whole cost of this step. It is cached by content under
``<cache>/examples/blobs/``, not by example, because many example projects
read that same regional DEM: running ``hmp example add 04`` a second time
downloads nothing and reports everything already cached. Every file is
checked against the sha256 the catalogue declares, and a mismatch deletes the
partial download rather than writing it.

.. note::

   ``--ref`` fetches from another git ref, and the environment variable
   ``HMP_EXAMPLES_SOURCE`` replaces the whole
   ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydroModPy/HydroModPy/<ref>`` prefix
   with another URL or a local directory, for an offline install or a
   mirror. See :doc:`/cli/example`.

Doing it by hand instead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only needed when the machine cannot reach GitHub from Python, or when you
want a specific file. The same files, the same folders:

.. code-block:: bash

   D=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydroModPy/HydroModPy/v2.0.0a1/examples/data

   curl -L -o ~/hydromodpy/data/dem/DEM_armorican_massif.tif "$D/dem/DEM_armorican_massif.tif"
   curl -L -o ~/hydromodpy/data/hydrography/nancon_stream_network.gpkg "$D/hydrography/nancon_stream_network.gpkg"
   curl -L -o ~/hydromodpy/data/hydrometry/hydrometry_custom_NANCON_19820201_20220125_D.csv \
       "$D/hydrometry/hydrometry_custom_NANCON_19820201_20220125_D.csv"
   curl -L -o ~/hydromodpy/data/recharge/recharge_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv \
       "$D/recharge/recharge_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv"
   curl -L -o ~/hydromodpy/data/runoff/runoff_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv \
       "$D/runoff/runoff_custom_NANCON_20000101_20021231_M.csv"

   B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydroModPy/HydroModPy/v2.0.0a1/examples/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient
   P=~/hydromodpy/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient

   mkdir -p $P
   for f in step1_minimal step2_local_data step3_api_data step4_transient step5_export; do
       curl -L -o $P/$f.toml "$B/$f.toml"
   done

Those five data files are what the five steps read. ``run_daily.toml`` also
reads the two ``NANCON_REA`` daily series, which ``hmp example add`` fetches
and this list leaves out.

6. The five-step staircase
-----------------------------

Each file below adds exactly one thing to its parent, declared through
``base_config``. Tables merge key by key, a list replaces the parent's
list, and ``<key>__append`` adds to it instead of replacing it; a bare
``<key>__delete = true`` drops an inherited key outright.

step1_minimal.toml — run ``nancon_step1_minimal``, no ``base_config``
   The shortest config that runs to completion on the Nançon catchment:
   steady state, the local DEM, one homogeneous ``K``, and a drainage
   boundary. Nothing here is optional; this is the floor.

   .. code-block:: bash

      hmp run ~/hydromodpy/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient/step1_minimal.toml

step2_local_data.toml — run ``nancon_step2_local``, ``base_config = "step1_minimal.toml"``
   Declares the local data sources the later steps read: the mapped stream
   network and the gauge. Still steady, and the head it solves is step 1's to
   the bit, which is the point worth noticing. A simulation driven by the
   drainage boundary reads ``mesh/topography``; burning the mapped network into
   the DEM reshapes the routing surface instead, which only the calibration
   criterion looks at. So this step buys you data on disk, not a different
   result.

step3_api_data.toml — run ``nancon_step3_api``, ``base_config = "step1_minimal.toml"``
   The same model as step 2, but the hydrography comes from the BD TOPAGE
   API and the hydrometry from Hub'Eau instead of local files. It is a
   **sibling** of step 2, not a child: both inherit only from step 1, and
   both should produce a comparable network from two different sources.
   Running it needs network access; step 2 does not.

step4_transient.toml — run ``nancon_step4_transient``, ``base_config = "step2_local_data.toml"``
   Switches to monthly transient, 2000-2002, with storage and the observed
   recharge and runoff forcing. This is the complete Nançon simulation,
   with no calibration: the parameters are still the assumed values from
   step 1, not fitted ones.

step5_export.toml — run ``nancon_step5_export``, ``base_config = "step4_transient.toml"``
   Adds a declarative ``[export]`` and a ``[display]`` figure list, four
   ``base_config`` levels deep. Run this last:

   .. code-block:: bash

      hmp run ~/hydromodpy/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient/step5_export.toml

   A format toggle such as ``geotiff = true`` writes one file per name in
   ``export.variables``, not one file, so naming four fields there makes
   this run produce six artifacts under ``share/nancon_step5_export/``:

   .. code-block:: text

      head_t33.tif                  the simulated head, October 2002
      watertable_elevation_t33.tif  the three derived fields, same instant
      watertable_depth_t33.tif
      seepage_mask_t33.tif
      timeseries.csv                every series, all 36 steps
      fields_2000_2002.nc           the explicit [[export.artifacts]] entry

   ``netcdf``, ``vtu``, ``shapefile`` and ``package`` are toggles beside
   ``geotiff``; ``[[export.artifacts]]`` names one file instead, its format
   taken from the destination extension, and is the only form that writes
   several timesteps into one file. The four ``[display]`` figures land in
   the run's ``figures/`` directory; use ``hmp viz show`` (section 7) to
   render any other registered figure for this run on demand.

Try a variation without writing a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``--overlay`` merges an extra TOML payload after the ``base_config`` chain;
``--set`` overrides one dotted path after that. Together they let you try a
change without saving a sixth step file:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat > /tmp/wetter_aquifer.toml <<'EOF'
   [flow.param.Sy.field]
   value = 0.08
   EOF

   hmp run ~/hydromodpy/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient/step4_transient.toml \
       --overlay /tmp/wetter_aquifer.toml \
       --set flow.param.K.field.value=1e-4

This runs step 4 with a higher specific yield from the overlay and a
higher ``K`` from ``--set``, without editing ``step4_transient.toml`` or
creating a new file that outlives the experiment.

7. Where to go next
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp viz list                                              # every registered figure name
   hmp viz show nancon_step5_export watershed_id_card         # re-render one figure on demand
   hmp catalog ls                                             # every run in this workspace
   hmp catalog show nancon_step5_export --detail              # metadata, metrics, Zarr layout

This page deliberately stops before calibration: the same Nançon project in
``examples/projects/04_streamflow_intermittence_in_transient/`` also carries
``run_calibration.toml``, which fits ``K`` and ``Sy`` instead of assuming
them, and ``run_calibration_by_hand.toml``, which runs the same two stages
with the method written out instead of named. See
:doc:`../user_guide/workflows/calibration` when step 4's assumed parameters
are not good enough, and
:doc:`../user_guide/workflows/stream-network-calibration` for the two-stage
method those two files run.

- :doc:`../user_guide/concepts/workspace-layout` for the resolution rules
  behind ``data/<variable>/`` and ``--workspace``.
- :doc:`../user_guide/results-and-exports` for what ``[export]`` can write
  besides GeoTIFF.
- :doc:`simulation-walkthrough` for a second end-to-end case, with Gmsh
  meshing instead of a structured grid.
