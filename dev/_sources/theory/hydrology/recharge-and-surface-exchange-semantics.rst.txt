Recharge And Surface-Exchange Semantics
=======================================

Purpose
-------

This page explains the physical meaning of the main hydrological quantities
that sit upstream of the groundwater solve:

- recharge,
- evapotranspiration,
- runoff,
- and surface-related exchange concepts such as stream, ocean, and drainage.

It complements :doc:`hydrological-forcing-chain`.

The distinction is deliberate:

- :doc:`hydrological-forcing-chain` describes the software and data path,
- this page describes the scientific meaning of the quantities carried by that
  path.

For a deeper treatment of boundary-like surface exchanges, see
:doc:`stream-ocean-and-drainage-semantics`.

Runtime Data-To-Flow Diagram
----------------------------

External datasets (recharge, ETP, runoff, hydrography, oceanic) are
turned into ``LoadResult`` payloads by the data managers. From there:

- recharge, ETP, and stage-capable inputs are passed through structure
  binders that build the recharge, ETP, or boundary payloads,
- the binders hand the diffuse forcing to
  ``forcing_bridge.resolve_forcing()``, which aligns the spatial mode,
  the time axis, and the units (``mm/day`` to ``m/s``, or stage in
  ``m``),
- the normalized forcing is plugged into ``FlowRechargeConfig``,
  ``FlowEtpConfig``, and the boundary mappings,
- the resulting ``Flow`` runtime is then forwarded to the solver
  adapters (MODFLOW-NWT, MODFLOW 6, Boussinesq).

Runoff is **not** routed through the Flow contract: it stays an
observation-side input that calibration and comparison consume directly.
Simulated heads, drainage, and baseflow from the Flow runtime are
combined with that runoff at evaluation time, where runoff may be added
to the DRN/baseflow signal.

Diffuse forcing and boundary support share one Flow contract, but they are
not the same physical category.

This diagram highlights a central distinction in the current design:
diffuse hydrological forcing is normalized into the ``Flow`` contract, while
runoff mainly remains an observation-side quantity for comparison and
calibration.

Result anchors
--------------

The semantic distinction becomes easier to keep straight when the reader sees
where each quantity appears in a result. The Nancon run is the practical
anchor; the analytical validation cases remain the precise mathematical
anchors listed near the end of the page.

Two Main Scientific Paths To Recharge
-------------------------------------

HydroModPy currently supports two broad ways to define recharge.

Direct groundwater forcing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recharge can be supplied directly as a groundwater-model forcing through:

- ``[data.recharge]`` and the data-manager layer,
- ``[flow.sinks_sources.recharge]`` in explicit project configuration,
- or synthetic recharge series used in examples, comparisons, and validation.

Scientifically, this means the modeller accepts recharge as an already derived
quantity. The land-surface balance has happened elsewhere, or is intentionally
abstracted away.

Hydrological preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recharge can also be produced by an upstream hydrological treatment, notably
through the PyHELP-related tooling and associated forcing pipelines.

Scientifically, this means HydroModPy receives a land-surface interpretation
before the groundwater solve:

- climatic inputs are transformed,
- recharge becomes one derived effective aquifer input,
- runoff and evapotranspiration may also be produced as companion outputs.

From the groundwater solver point of view, both paths converge to the same
canonical quantity: a recharge forcing eventually normalized into
``FlowRechargeConfig``.

Units And Normalization
-----------------------

The repository already follows a useful unit policy, even if it was not yet
written in one scientific page.

Data-layer conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At data-manager level, the internal conventions are currently:

- recharge: ``mm/day``,
- ETP: ``mm/day``,
- runoff: ``mm/day``.

This convention is explicit in the variable-manager layer and in the generic
forcing bridge.

Runtime ``Flow`` conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once bound to the ``Flow`` runtime, the main groundwater quantities are
normalized to solver-facing SI units:

- recharge: ``m/s``,
- ETP: ``m/s``,
- well rates: ``m3/s``,
- head or stage values: ``m``.

This is one of the important scientific simplifications in the codebase:
backend adapters receive normalized process quantities rather than having to
interpret many source units themselves.

Runoff is handled differently
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runoff does not currently enter the ``Flow`` process as a groundwater forcing.
Instead, it remains a loaded hydrological quantity that can be reused later for
comparison or calibration.

In calibration, the current logic can add runoff to the simulated groundwater
release signal to compare against total observed streamflow at outlet scale.

Spatial Semantics
-----------------

The generic forcing bridge already distinguishes three spatial modes:

- ``auto``,
- ``homogeneous``,
- ``heterogeneous``.

``auto``
^^^^^^^^

In ``auto`` mode, the current policy is:

- point records are reduced to one homogeneous time series,
- field records are kept as heterogeneous forcing sources,
- located points can also become heterogeneous if no usable homogeneous series
  is available.

This is a pragmatic modelling default:

- station-style forcings naturally become basin-average signals,
- gridded products naturally remain spatially distributed.

``homogeneous``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``homogeneous`` mode, HydroModPy forces a spatially averaged
interpretation:

- multiple point stations are averaged,
- gridded fields can be reduced to one spatial mean per time step.

This is scientifically useful when the purpose is:

- a reduced-order benchmark,
- an inter-solver comparison on one common lumped forcing,
- or a first exploratory run before introducing heterogeneity.

``heterogeneous``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``heterogeneous`` mode, the loaded forcing is preserved for later
discretization onto the solver mesh.

The important point is that the data layer does not discretize it immediately.
It stores one source that is later projected or interpolated to the actual
solver mesh once that mesh exists.

Current interpolation keywords are:

- ``nearest``,
- ``linear``,
- ``idw``.

Temporal Semantics
------------------

HydroModPy also separates two temporal questions that are often mixed in
groundwater documentation.

For the exact public contract on stress-period aggregation and the historical
``first_clim`` convention, see
:doc:`forcing-time-aggregation-and-first-clim`.

Stress-period alignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The generic forcing bridge aligns time series to the simulation window using
the following current rule:

- one output value per stress period,
- arithmetic mean of all values inside the interval
  ``[period_start, period_end)``,
- if no sample falls inside the interval, reuse the latest value available
  before period end.

This policy is simple, explicit, and uniform across climatic variables.

``first_clim`` policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recharge and ETP runtime configs also retain a ``first_clim`` policy. Its role
is to control how the first solver period is represented when the backend later
consumes a scalar or sequence payload.

Current accepted values are:

- ``"mean"``,
- ``"first"``,
- or one explicit numeric value.

Scientifically, this is most useful for warm-up or representative-initial-period
setups. It should not be confused with the general stress-period alignment
itself.

Sign Semantics And Current Policies
-----------------------------------

Recharge
^^^^^^^^

Positive recharge means water added to the aquifer.

This is the canonical interpretation at ``Flow`` level, regardless of whether
the recharge came from:

- a direct recharge dataset,
- a synthetic series,
- or an upstream hydrological preprocessing step.

Dedicated ETP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When ETP is explicitly bound to ``Flow``, it is treated as a diffuse
extraction term. Positive values therefore mean water removed from the
groundwater system.

Negative Recharge Routed To EVT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current codebase supports one pragmatic policy:

- negative recharge values can be clipped out of recharge,
- and their magnitude can be rerouted to an ``EVT``-style sink through
  ``negative_to_evt``.

This is useful, but it should be described honestly:

- it is a net-loss policy,
- it is not a full land-surface energy-balance model,
- it is not the same thing as documenting one independent physical theory of
  evapotranspiration.

Runoff
^^^^^^

Runoff is not currently injected into the groundwater solver as a source or
sink term.

Its main current roles are:

- loaded hydrological information,
- hydrometric comparison support,
- calibration-side complement to groundwater discharge or drainage release.

That distinction matters a lot for interpretation:

- recharge changes aquifer mass directly,
- runoff currently changes mainly the observation-side interpretation of outlet
  flow comparisons.

What Counts As Surface Exchange
-------------------------------

The repository mixes several notions that all involve the ground surface or a
surface interface, but they should remain conceptually distinct.

Climatic or hydrological forcing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- recharge,
- ETP,
- upstream precipitation-derived products.

These are imposed forcing quantities that enter the model because they are
interpreted as externally supplied water gains or losses.

Boundary or exchange operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- stream,
- ocean,
- drainage.

These do not primarily represent climatic forcing. They represent exchange laws
or boundary states linking the aquifer to one external compartment.

Observation-side hydrological signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- runoff,
- hydrometry.

These are usually used to evaluate the simulation, not to define the internal
groundwater equation directly.

Solver-Specific Surface Closures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Boussinesq backend also contains solver-side surface-interaction closures
such as regularized saturation excess.

Those closures should not be conflated with:

- direct runoff observations,
- the drainage boundary operator,
- or the generic recharge forcing.

Current Code Path At A Glance
-----------------------------

The current public path can be summarized as:

.. code-block:: text

   external climatic or recharge data
   -> data manager LoadResult
   -> forcing_bridge.resolve_forcing()
   -> FlowRechargeConfig / FlowEtpConfig
   -> Flow runtime
   -> solver adapter
   -> recharge, EVT, or related package/operator payloads

The runoff path is different:

.. code-block:: text

   external runoff data
   -> loaded_data.runoff
   -> calibration / comparison logic
   -> optional combination with simulated groundwater-release signal

Validation And Comparison Anchors
---------------------------------

Useful pages already exist to anchor the main meanings described here.

- Steady uniform recharge:
  :doc:`Dupuit Uniform Recharge 1D <../../capability_gallery/cases/dupuit_uniform_recharge_1d>`
- Transient recharge step:
  :doc:`Linearized Unconfined 1D Recharge Step <../../capability_gallery/cases/linearized_unconfined_recharge_step_1d>`
- Periodic recharge forcing:
  :doc:`Linearized Unconfined 1D Periodic Recharge <../../capability_gallery/cases/linearized_unconfined_recharge_periodic_1d>`
- Recharge plus emergent drainage across code families:
  :doc:`Surface-Interaction Ramp Code Comparison <../../capability_gallery/cases/surface_interaction_ramp_code_comparison>`
- Stream, ocean, and drainage semantics in more detail:
  :doc:`stream-ocean-and-drainage-semantics`

Why This Page Matters
---------------------

Without this semantic split, several misleading readings become almost
inevitable:

- treating runoff as if it were already recharge,
- treating negative recharge as if it were a full ETP theory,
- treating stream or ocean stage as if it were climatic forcing,
- treating drainage as if it were only a postprocessing signal.

The scientific documentation needs those distinctions if it wants to explain
why two HydroModPy runs may use the same groundwater solver but represent very
different hydrological assumptions upstream.
