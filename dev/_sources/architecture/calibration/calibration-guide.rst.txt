Calibration Guide
=================

Audience: hydrogeologists, modelers, and HydroModPy contributors who
need to calibrate the parameters of a catchment-scale groundwater
model. Suggested reading order: §1 (principles), §2 (workflow), §3
(TOML), §7 (reading the results). Sections §4 to §9 are reference
material to consult once the loop is running.

This guide is the single source of truth for the calibration
sub-system. Code: ``hydromodpy/calibration/``.

For complementary reading, see :doc:`index` (calibration architecture
root), :doc:`../overview/design-patterns` (item 7 covers the calibration
adapters), :doc:`../overview/two-databases`, and
:doc:`../../user_guide/workflows/calibration`.

Overview
--------

A HydroModPy calibration is an ask/tell loop that iteratively adjusts a
few model parameters (hydraulic conductivity ``K``, specific yield
``Sy``, drain conductance) so that the simulated output matches a
reference series (discharge at a station, head at a piezometer). The
loop is driven by an optimizer that proposes values and reacts to a
scalar objective (NSE, KGE, RMSE) computed at every trial.

Compared to a plain ``hmp run``, a calibration:

- produces a trace of N evaluations (one row per trial in the DuckDB
  catalog), not a single simulation;
- reuses the expensive setup steps (geographic, mesh, data loading)
  across trials through the ``prepare-once-evaluate-many`` primitive;
- only writes the best runs to disk as full Zarr / Parquet
  simulations. Other trials remain as lightweight rows in DuckDB;
- can be resumed across sessions through the content-addressed
  ``params_hash`` cache.

Use a calibration to fit a model to observations. Use a plain
``hmp run`` when the parameters are already known.

Specific terms used in this guide:

- ``TrialContext``: prepared runtime, reused by every trial of a
  session (§2, §4).
- ``earliest_affected_step``: integer that decides which pipeline
  steps are skipped per trial (§4).
- ``params_hash``: SHA-256 fingerprint used by the cross-session cache
  (§8).
- ``promote_trial``: action that turns a lightweight trial row into a
  complete Zarr / Parquet simulation (§2, §5).

End-to-end workflow
-------------------

.. list-table:: Calibration data flow
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 76

   * - Stage
     - What flows into it and what it produces
   * - ``TOML``
     - User config with ``[workflow].mode = "calibration"``. Read by ``hmp run``.
   * - ``hmp run``
     - Dispatches the TOML to ``prepare_trials``.
   * - ``prepare_trials``
     - Runs pipeline steps ``[0..earliest)`` once. Builds the prepared
       ``WorkflowContext`` consumed by the ask/tell loop.
   * - Ask/tell loop (``run_trial_light``)
     - Each trial reads the prepared context, appends one line to
       ``sessions/<name>/trials.jsonl`` and writes one row to DuckDB
       (``calibration_iterations``). After the loop ends, control passes
       to ``promote_trial``.
   * - Session journal (``sessions/<name>/``)
     - The history on disk: ``session.json`` (identity, search space,
       objective, dates, best trial) and ``trials.jsonl``. Read back by
       ``hmp catalog reindex``.
   * - DuckDB (``calibration_sessions`` + ``calibration_iterations``)
     - Indexes trial fingerprints and session metadata. Read by
       ``hmp report render``, rebuilt from the session journal.
   * - ``promote_trial`` (top-N)
     - Replays the chosen trials through the full pipeline. Writes
       Zarr + Parquet + ``simulations`` rows and back-fills
       ``calibration_iterations.sim_id``.
   * - Catalog (simulations + Zarr + Parquet)
     - Read by ``hmp report render`` alongside the DuckDB iteration
       history.
   * - ``hmp report render``
     - Reads sessions, iterations, simulation outputs, and renders the
       calibration HTML report with figures.

Node by node:

- **TOML**: a regular HydroModPy project TOML extended with a
  ``[calibration]`` section and a top-level
  ``[workflow].mode = "calibration"`` marker. The rest of the file
  (``[simulation]``, ``[flow]``, ``[data]``, ``[solver]``) is exactly
  what you would write for a single run.
- **``hmp run``**: the unified CLI entry point. It reads
  ``[workflow].mode = "calibration"`` and dispatches to
  ``hydromodpy.calibration.runners.cli_runner.run_calibration_cli``. Calibration
  has no separate top-level subcommand.
- **``prepare_trials``**: runs pipeline steps ``[0..earliest)`` exactly
  once. ``earliest`` is computed from the dotted paths declared by
  ``[calibration.parameters.*]`` (see §4). The prepared
  ``WorkflowContext`` (geographic, mesh, loaded forcings) is held in
  RAM and forked by every trial.
- **Ask/tell loop**: the optimizer proposes a parameter point, the
  loop forks the prepared context, injects the values, runs steps
  ``[earliest..8]`` in **lightweight** mode (no disk writes beyond the
  solver's own scratch files), extracts the scalar objective from RAM,
  and tells the optimizer. Repeat up to ``max_iter``.
- **Session journal**: the session owns ``sessions/<name>/`` at the
  project root. ``session.json`` is written before the first trial and
  rewritten with the outcome at the end; ``trials.jsonl`` gains one line
  per trial as it completes, so an interrupted calibration keeps its
  history. See :doc:`/architecture/storage-layout`.
- **DuckDB**: every trial adds one row to ``calibration_iterations``
  (``sim_id`` stays ``NULL``). The session metadata lives in one row
  of ``calibration_sessions`` finalized at the end. Both tables are an
  index over the session journal: ``hmp catalog reindex`` rebuilds them
  from it.
- **``promote_trial`` (top-N)**: if ``save_runs != "none"``, the
  chosen trials are replayed through the *full* pipeline (steps
  ``00..11``) by ``hydromodpy.Project(cfg_path).simulate(**values)``. Each
  promotion creates a Zarr store, a Parquet directory, and a
  ``simulations`` row, and back-fills the corresponding
  ``calibration_iterations.sim_id``.
- **``hmp report render <session_ref>``**: post-processing CLI that
  reads the session descriptor and its trial log, renders the six
  calibration figures, and emits a standalone HTML report at
  ``<project>/share/reports/<session_name>/report.html``. The reference
  accepts a session id or prefix, or one of its runs; omitted, it renders
  the most recent session.

The user TOML
-------------

The examples below come from the canonical case shipped with the
repository:
``examples/projects/02_nancon_watershed/run_calibration_k.toml``.

Overlay and workflow marker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: toml

   base_config = "project.toml"

   [workflow]
   mode = "calibration"

- ``base_config``: relative path to the *base* project TOML
  (``project.toml`` here). All sections of the base are inherited and
  overridden by the current file. This is how a single description of
  the catchment is shared between simulation, calibration, and sweep
  overlays.
- ``[workflow].mode = "calibration"``: the single switch that tells
  ``hmp run`` to dispatch to the ask/tell loop instead of the default
  single-simulation path. Dispatch logic lives in
  ``hydromodpy/project/dispatch/workflow.py:DISPATCH``.

Standard simulation block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: toml

   [simulation]
   name = "nancon_calibration_k"
   description = "Optuna calibration of K on NSE(discharge), Sy/Ss frozen."

   [simulation.time]
   start_datetime = "2000-01-01"
   end_datetime = "2002-12-31"
   step_value = "1 month"
   coverage_policy = "warn"

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "flow_main"
   type = "flow"
   solvers = ["modflow_nwt"]

The ``[simulation]`` tree is exactly what you write for a single
``hmp run``: a name, a time window, and one or more processes.
**Changing the solver does not change anything in the
``[calibration]`` section**: the calibration code is solver-agnostic
(no ``modflow``, ``modflow6``, ``boussinesq``, or ``solver.backend``
string appears anywhere in ``hydromodpy/calibration/``). Swap
``"modflow_nwt"`` for ``"modflow6"`` and the same TOML calibrates the
other solver (subject to the metric extractor coverage noted in §6).

Frozen parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: toml

   [domain.depth_model]
   thickness = 30.0

   [flow.param.Sy.field]
   value = 0.05

   [flow.param.Ss.field]
   value = 1e-5

   [flow.sinks_sources.recharge]
   first_clim = "first"

Any leaf not listed under ``[calibration.parameters.*]`` is **frozen**
at the value written in the TOML. Here ``Sy`` and ``Ss`` are frozen at
``0.05`` and ``1e-5``; only ``K`` is calibrated.

Automatic step invalidation
---------------------------

Every pipeline step declares which TOML subtrees it reads via a
``config_sections`` class variable. When a calibration mutates
``flow.param.K.field.value``, only the steps that consume ``flow.*``
(and their downstream siblings) need to re-run. The earlier steps
produce the same result on every trial and are executed exactly once
inside ``prepare_trials``.

  ``TrialContext.ctx`` and are shared by reference across every fork.
- **Orange (looped)**: steps ``06..08``. Re-run per trial in
  ``run_trial_light``. The trial fork deep-copies the config, injects
  the new parameter values, and re-executes this slice only.
- **Blue (promoted)**: steps ``09..11``. Never run during the
  calibration loop. Executed only for the trials picked up by
  ``promote_trial`` after the loop converges.

**Matching rule: dotted longest-prefix.** Given an override path like
``flow.param.K.field.value``, the selector walks each step's
``config_sections`` and accepts a match when the section is a
dotted-prefix of the path. ``flow`` matches, ``flow.param.K``
matches, ``flow.param.K.field.value`` matches, but ``flow_runtime``
does not. The lowest index among matching steps wins; everything
downstream of it is forced to re-run even if its own sections did not
match (step 08 Extract, for instance, has empty
``config_sections``, yet it re-runs because it consumes the state
produced by step 07).

Implementation:
``hydromodpy/workflow/internals/dependencies.py:earliest_affected_step``.
Per-step annotations: ``config_sections: ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]]``

   * - ``sessions/<session_name>/``
     - ``trials.jsonl``
     - The trial log: one JSON object per evaluated trial, appended
       live. An interrupted calibration keeps every trial it had time
       to evaluate.
   * - ``.hmp/index.duckdb``
     - ``calibration_sessions``, ``calibration_iterations``
     - Index over the two journal files, rebuilt from them by

   * - ``.hmp/index.duckdb``
     - ``simulations``, ``parameters``, ``metrics``, ``tags``

   * - ``share/reports/<session_name>/``
     - ``figures/*.png`` and ``report.html``
     - Rendered post-loop by ``hmp report render <session ref>``.

Rule of thumb: **RAM inside the loop, the session journal for the trace,
a run directory only for promoted trials.** The index is derived from
both and never holds anything the disk does not.

**Recommendation.** Use ``save_runs = "best_n"`` as your default. It
keeps the full trace queryable in DuckDB while only materializing the
trials you might actually inspect later. Use ``"all"`` only for short
diagnostic calibrations (<= 20 trials) when you want every single run
on disk.

``optimizer_kwargs`` hints:

- ``grid``: ``{ "n_points": {K = 10, Sy = 5} }`` to set per-parameter
  granularity. Defaults to a uniform count across all parameters.
- ``optuna``:
  ``{ "sampler": "tpe" | "cmaes" | "random", "pruner": "median" }``.
  Default sampler is TPE and is available in the base install; ``cmaes``
  requires the calibration extra and is strongly recommended when you
  have 3+ continuous parameters.
- ``scipy_de``:
  ``{ "popsize": 15, "mutation": [0.5, 1.0], "recombination": 0.7 }``,
  the standard ``scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`` knobs.
- ``scipy_nelder_mead``:
  ``{ "xatol": 1e-4, "fatol": 1e-4, "adaptive": true }``.
  ``adaptive = true`` is friendlier in higher dimensions.
- ``gp_mapping``: ``{ "n_initial": 10, "acq": "ei" }``: expected
  improvement over an RBF Gaussian Process surrogate.
- ``da_mh_gp``:
  ``{ "burn_in": 200, "thin": 5, "proposal_scale": 0.3 }``,
  Metropolis-Hastings tuned by the surrogate.

Reading the results
-------------------

Python API and DuckDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import hydromodpy as hmp

   catalog = hmp.open("~/workspace/projects/<name>")
   sessions = catalog.calibration_sessions()
   iters = catalog.calibration_iterations(session_id=sessions.iloc[0]["session_id"])
   best = catalog.best(project="calibration", metric="nse")
   hmp.figure(best, "watertable_depth_map", save="~/figures/")
   print(iters.head())

- ``catalog.calibration_sessions()`` returns a ``DataFrame`` with one
  row per session (method, objective, best_objective, duration_s).
- ``catalog.calibration_iterations(session_id=...)`` returns the full
  per-trial trace (parameters, objective_value, status, sim_id,
  params_hash).
- ``catalog.best(project, metric)`` returns a ``Run`` object for the
  best promoted trial across sessions matching ``project``.

Figures via the display registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Six named figures ship with HydroModPy. Each implements the ``Figure``
Protocol and is registered in
``hydromodpy/display/figures/__init__.py``.

- ``calibration_convergence``: best-so-far objective vs iteration.
- ``calibration_trace``: parallel plots of every parameter and the
  objective across iterations.
- ``calibration_landscape``: 2D scatter of any pair of parameters
  coloured by objective value.
- ``calibration_posterior``: marginal histograms per parameter.
- ``calibration_objective_surface``: interpolated NSE surface over
  any 2-parameter slice.
- ``calibration_pairplot``: pairwise grid of scatter plus
  histograms.

Render one figure at a time from the CLI. ``hmp viz show`` takes a run
reference and a figure name, so point it at a promoted run of the
session (``hmp catalog ls --tag calibration:<session_id>`` lists them):

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_convergence
   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_trace
   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_landscape
   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_posterior
   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_objective_surface
   hmp viz show <run_ref> calibration_pairplot

Without ``--output`` the PNG lands in ``runs/<run>/figures/``.
``hmp report render`` renders the whole set in one go.

Pre-rendered examples for a Dupuit / MODFLOW 6 twin benchmark live
under ``docs/source/_static/capability_gallery/calibration/``: reuse
them as visual references.

The loop can also render figures automatically at the end of the
session by listing them under ``[display] figures = [...]`` in the
TOML.

HTML report
~~~~~~~~~~~

For users who do not want to drop into Python:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp report render <session_ref> --open

The report embeds the six figures together with a summary table
(method, objective, best parameters, best_sim_id, duration). It is
fully standalone: the HTML file plus its sibling PNGs can be shipped
as a single folder.

Cross-session cache and reproducibility
---------------------------------------

Every trial is fingerprinted by a ``params_hash``: the SHA-256 of its
canonical parameter JSON representation (keys sorted, floats
normalized). The hash is written on every ``calibration_iterations``
row.

- ``use_cache = true`` (default): before running a trial, the engine
  looks up ``params_hash`` in the ``ParamsHashCache``. The cache is
  preloaded at session start from every *completed* and *promoted*
  iteration of every previous session on the same workspace. On a
  hit, the ``sim_id`` is reused, the solver is skipped entirely, and
  the cached objective value is returned.
- ``seed = 42``: seeds the sampler. Combined with a deterministic
  solver, this makes the whole sequence reproducible. Leave ``null``
  for stochastic exploration.

Disable the cache (``use_cache = false``) when:

- the input data changed (new forcings, new DEM, new observations);
- the solver version changed;
- you want to benchmark true per-trial wall time.

Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
-------------------------------------

- **``path`` points to a missing field.** The engine raises a
  ``CalibrationSetupError`` with the list of valid paths.
  Double-check with ``hmp doctor --toml run_calibration_k.toml``.
- **Bounds too tight.** The optimizer converges on a plateau and
  reports a false "best". Widen ``bounds`` and re-run.
- **``transform = "identity"`` for K from 1e-6 to 1e-3.** Uniform
  sampling in the physical space burns 99% of the budget on the top
  decade. Always use ``transform = "log"`` for multi-order quantities
  (K, conductances, storage coefficients).
- **``save_runs = "all"`` on 100 trials.** You end up with ~50 GB of
  Zarr. Use ``best_n`` unless you really want every trial on disk.
- **``max_iter`` too low for a Bayesian method.** Optuna TPE needs
  at least ~50 trials before exploiting; ``da_mh_gp`` needs a few
  hundred before the posterior stabilizes.
- **Variable ``"discharge"`` but no hydrometry in ``[data]``.** The
  metric extractor returns ``NaN`` on every trial; the session
  completes in seconds with no usable output. Check that
  ``[data.hydrometry]`` (or ``[data.piezometry]`` for head) is
  populated.
- **MODFLOW 6 + discharge calibration.** The extractor in
  ``hydromodpy.calibration.metrics`` currently covers MODFLOW-NWT
  only; MODFLOW 6 returns ``NaN``. Scheduled as future work: use
  MODFLOW-NWT in the meantime, or plug in a custom extractor through
  §10.
- **Forgetting ``[workflow].mode = "calibration"``.** ``hmp run``
  then treats the TOML as a simulation and runs ``K`` exactly once
  with its default value. The ``[calibration]`` section is silently
  ignored.

Python API reference
--------------------

Programmatic entry point (no CLI needed):

.. code-block:: python

   from hydromodpy.calibration.runners.cli_runner import run_calibration_cli

   summary = run_calibration_cli(
       "run_calibration_k.toml",
       objective="mypkg.metrics:custom_nse",
       workspace="~/workspace",
       project="nancon_K",
   )
   print(summary["best_sim_id"], summary["best_objective"])

- The positional argument is the TOML path; resolved relative to the
  current working directory.
- ``objective="module.path:fn"`` is the Python escape hatch. The
  callable must match the ``TrialMetricFn`` signature
  ``(ctx, *, objective, variable) -> (primary_metric, {component: value})``.
  Use it when the default NSE / KGE / RMSE extractor does not fit
  your variable (multi-station weighted, filtered seasons, etc.).
- ``workspace`` overrides the workspace root resolved from the TOML
  (same rule as the binary resolver in ``WorkspaceConfig``).
- ``project`` is a free string written to
  ``calibration_sessions.project``.

Return dict keys:

.. code-block:: text

   session_id, method, n_iterations, best_objective,
   best_sim_id, duration_s, save_runs, promoted

Low-level primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CLI is a thin wrapper around three primitives you can call
directly for custom orchestration:

.. code-block:: python

   from hydromodpy.calibration.runners.trial import (
       prepare_trials, run_trial_light, promote_trial,
   )

   trial_ctx = prepare_trials(
       "run_calibration_k.toml",
       override_paths={"K": "flow.param.K.field.value"},
   )
   result = run_trial_light(
       trial_ctx, {"K": 1e-4},
       objective="nse", variable="discharge",
   )
   if result.status == "completed":
       sim_id = promote_trial(
           "run_calibration_k.toml",
           {"K": 1e-4},
           paths={"K": "flow.param.K.field.value"},
           name="manual_k_1e-4",
       )

Useful diagnostics on a persisted trace:

.. code-block:: python

   from hydromodpy.calibration.optim.diagnostics import (
       convergence_rate, parameter_correlation,
   )

   rate = convergence_rate(iters)
   print(rate["slope"], rate["r_squared"])
   corr = parameter_correlation(iters, parameters=["K", "Sy"])
   print(corr)

Render a specific figure programmatically (equivalent to the
``hmp viz show`` call above):

.. code-block:: python

   from pathlib import Path
   import hydromodpy as hmp

   catalog = hmp.open("~/workspace/projects/<name>")
   run = catalog["abcd1234"]
   fig = hmp.figure(
       run,
       "calibration_convergence",
       save=Path("~/figures/convergence.png").expanduser(),
   )

Analytical test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two pure-Python demos ship for local experimentation (no MODFLOW
install needed):

- ``hydromodpy.calibration.cases.recession_brutsaert``: hydrograph
  recession fit (``Q(t) = Q0 * exp(-t/tau)``) used as the golden for
  ``grid_search``, ``random_search``, ``nelder_mead``, ``simplex``,
  ``cma_es``, ``gp_mapping``, ``da_mh_gp``.
- ``hydromodpy.calibration.cases.groundwater_1d``: 1D synthetic
  aquifer with analytical head profile.

They are the quickest way to check that a new optimizer adapter
behaves against the known-good ``METHOD_ABS_TOL`` tolerances.
