Pipeline resume from artefacts
==============================

The simulation pipeline rebuilds its in-memory state exclusively from
durable artefacts and the TOML config. There is no pickle layer, no
``CheckpointStore``, and no signed-blob deserialisation. Resume relies on
three sources of truth:

#. ``<workspace>/.hmp/checkpoints/<run_id>/resolved_manifest.json``: tracks
   the step blueprint, the config SHA-256, and the cursor.
#. ``workflow_steps`` (DuckDB): per-step inputs/outputs hashes,
   ``artifact_uris`` and status.
#. Zarr / Parquet / DuckDB rows on disk.

Invariant
---------

  *Pipeline state at step N is a pure function of the persisted
  artefacts produced by steps 0 to N-1, plus the resolved config.*

Any step that produces durable output declares both ``artifacts(state)``
(workspace-relative URIs) and ``rebuild_state(prior_state, workspace,
run_id)``. The first method drives ``outputs_hash`` in the journal; the
second one reconstructs the next ``PipelineState`` by reading those same
artefacts (Zarr handles, catalog rows, parquet exports) without
re-running the heavy operation.

Two-phase execution
-------------------

``Pipeline.run`` operates in two phases:

* **Rebuild phase** ``[0, restart_index)``: every step either gets
  re-executed (cheap, idempotent: validate, resolve, geographic, data,
  mesh, setup) or its output state is rebuilt from artefacts
  (``prepare_solver``, ``run_solver``, ``extract``, ``export``). The
  journal is not written during this phase.
* **Execute phase** ``[restart_index, end)``: each step runs fully; the
  journal records inputs/outputs hashes and the heartbeat appends rows to
  ``workflow_events``.

Resume integrity
----------------

Before any work starts, two guards check that the workspace has not
drifted:

* ``ResolvedRunManifest.verify_state`` compares the blueprint and the
  config SHA-256 with what was written at the previous attempt. A
  mismatch raises :class:`hydromodpy.core.exceptions.ResumeError`.
* ``ResumePlanner.compute`` checks every completed row in
  ``workflow_steps``: artefacts must still exist and ``outputs_hash``
  must match a recomputed digest. Any divergence cascade-invalidates the
  rows from the offending step onwards and the runner restarts there.

When ``resume_from`` is ``None`` (or 0), the runner first calls
``WorkflowJournal.invalidate_from(start_order=0, reason="from_scratch")``
so a stale journal from a reused ``run_id`` cannot leak into the new run.

Step contract recap
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

   class Step(Protocol):
       name: str
       reads: ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]]
       writes: ClassVar[tuple[str, ...]]

       def run(self, state_in: PipelineState) -> PipelineState: ...

       def artifacts(self, state_out: PipelineState) -> tuple[str, ...]:
           """Workspace-relative paths of durable outputs. Empty tuple = in-memory."""

       def rebuild_state(
           self,
           *,
           prior_state: PipelineState,
           workspace: Path,
           run_id: str,
       ) -> PipelineState:
           """Restore the output state from disk. Must not re-run the heavy op."""

In-memory steps (no ``artifacts``) are simply re-executed at resume:
they must stay idempotent and fast.

Surviving a process death
-------------------------

A resume exists for the deaths that run no handler: a lost machine, the
OOM killer, a cancelled job. Nothing is flushed on the way out, so what
the next process can do is decided entirely by what the disk already
holds.

Two consequences follow, and both are gated by
``tests/e2e/test_resume_through_a_process_death.py``, which kills its own
child with ``SIGKILL`` twice.

* The step that was running when the process died keeps the status
  ``running``, not ``failed``. ``failed`` is what an exception writes.
  ``ResumePlanner`` restarts at that step either way.
* The project index has to be openable afterwards. DuckDB commits into
  ``.hmp/index.duckdb.wal`` and only folds it into the database file at a
  clean close, and a journal carrying schema DDL is not replayable: the
  replay runs inside ``duckdb.connect``, so a poisoned journal locks
  every reader out, ``hmp`` and the DuckDB CLI alike. The migration
  runner therefore checkpoints after each applied migration
  (``hydromodpy/core/migrations/runner.py``), which leaves the journal
  holding plain row changes. Those replay, and
  ``connect_with_retry`` checkpoints them back at the next open.
