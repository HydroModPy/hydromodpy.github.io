Hydrographic Network UML Diagrams
=================================

Scope
-----

These diagrams document the software architecture around the hydrographic
network concept introduced to unify:

- the loaded reference network from ``data.hydrography``,
- the DEM-derived generated network from ``geographic.river_network``,
- the persisted run features used later by display and comparison layers.

They focus on responsibilities, runtime handoffs, and the difference between
canonical concepts and technical preprocessing bundles.

Code map
--------

- ``hydromodpy/spatial/geographic/core/hydrographic_network.py``:
  canonical network classes and naming contract.
- ``hydromodpy/spatial/geographic/core/hydrographic_network_comparison.py``:
  comparison result and geometric metrics.
- ``hydromodpy/spatial/geographic/core/river_network.py``:
  DEM-derived preprocessing outputs (`RiverNetworkProducts`).
- ``hydromodpy/spatial/geographic/core/derived_features.py``:
  geographic bundle that carries canonical network roles.
- ``hydromodpy/workflow/steps/prepare_solver.py`` and
  ``hydromodpy/spatial/geographic/store_ingestion.py``:
  persistence into the catalog.
- ``hydromodpy/results/run.py``:
  read facade and comparison accessors.
- ``hydromodpy/display/figures/hydrographic_network*.py``:
  standalone and comparison figures.

Class Diagram
-------------

Use this diagram when the main question is:
"which class is canonical, which one is technical, and which one is only a
comparison result?"

.. uml:: diagrams/hydrographic_network_class_map.wsd

Runtime Component Diagram
-------------------------

Use this diagram when the main question is:
"where does the network come from, how is it persisted, and who consumes it?"

.. uml:: diagrams/hydrographic_network_runtime_components.wsd

End-to-End Sequence Diagram
---------------------------

Use this diagram when the main question is:
"what is the order of operations from loading/generation to comparison?"

.. uml:: diagrams/hydrographic_network_runtime_sequence.wsd

Availability Activity Diagram
-----------------------------

Use this diagram when the main question is:
"what happens when only one role exists, or when neither role exists?"

.. uml:: diagrams/hydrographic_network_availability_activity.wsd

Persistence And Run API Sequence Diagram
----------------------------------------

Use this diagram when the main question is:
"how do the persisted features reach the ``Run`` API, and what errors should a
developer expect when a role is missing?"

.. uml:: diagrams/hydrographic_network_persistence_run_sequence.wsd

Persistence And Run API Notes
-----------------------------

From a developer point of view, the most important operational split is:

- ``prepare_solver.py`` persists the loaded reference role when
  ``data.hydrography`` produced one usable vector network.
- ``store_ingestion.py`` persists the generated role when the geographic
  preprocessing produced one usable DEM-derived network.
- ``SimulationCatalog`` stores those features under canonical names only.
- ``Run`` does not guess. It first exposes the stored roles through
  ``available_hydrographic_network_roles()`` and ``has_hydrographic_network(...)``,
  then only enables comparison if both roles are present.

This means the runtime contract is intentionally asymmetric:

- persistence is tolerant and simply skips missing roles,
- reading one missing role raises a clear ``KeyError``,
- comparing two roles when one is absent raises a clear ``ValueError``,
- figure availability follows the same rule through ``run.display_capabilities``.

Which UML Diagrams Are Worth Maintaining?
-----------------------------------------

For this topic, the highest-value diagrams are:

1. A class diagram for the distinction between ``HydrographicNetwork``,
   ``HydrographicNetworks``, ``HydrographicNetworkComparison``, and
   ``RiverNetworkProducts``.
2. A component diagram for the source -> canonical object -> persistence ->
   consumer chain.
3. A sequence diagram for the end-to-end runtime path, including the
   "missing role" branch.
4. An activity diagram for the availability branches and output gating.
5. A developer-facing sequence diagram for persistence and ``Run`` behavior.

These three diagrams answer the most common maintenance questions:

- where should a new field live?
- where should a conversion happen?
- when should a role be present or absent?
- who is allowed to compare or display the networks?

Lower-value diagrams for this topic are:

- state-machine diagrams, because these objects do not have a rich internal
  lifecycle;
- deployment diagrams, because there is no interesting multi-node deployment
  question here;
- exhaustive inheritance diagrams, because the hydrographic-network stack is
  composition-oriented rather than inheritance-heavy.

If more detail is needed later, the next useful addition would be one small
package-level component diagram focused only on:

- ``prepare_solver.py``
- ``store_ingestion.py``
- ``Run``
- the display figure registry
- the comparison export orchestrator
