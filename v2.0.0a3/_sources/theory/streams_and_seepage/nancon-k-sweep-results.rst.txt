Nancon K-Sweep Results
======================

Purpose
-------

This page keeps one concrete simulation result close to the streams and
seepage concepts. It is not a calibration result. It is a visual and numerical
development case used to inspect how the simulation-derived active network
changes when hydraulic conductivity varies.

This is the MODFLOW 6 real-basin example for the conceptual sequence:

.. code-block:: text

   solved head -> local drain/seepage outflow -> accumulation_flux
   -> persistent simulated-active mask -> overlap against reference

Use it after :doc:`conceptual-model` and :doc:`worked-examples`, not before.
The conceptual pages explain why the active network is a diagnostic derived
from seepage or drainage outflow, while this page shows how that diagnostic
behaves in one concrete parameter sweep.

The comparison target is the observed ``reference`` hydrographic network. If a
run has no ``reference`` network, the simulated-active overlap comparison is
skipped; HydroModPy does not silently compare against the DEM-derived
``generated`` network.

Parameter Range
---------------

This sweep is aligned with the higher-conductivity Nancon parameter examples,
especially the ``F`` family in
``examples/projects/09_comparison_workflow/run_nancon_parameter_sweep.py``.
The range is deliberately widened around that family so that the visual
sensitivity of the simulated active network is easier to inspect.

The sweep uses:

- ``K = 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4, 5e-4 m/s``
- ``Ss = 1e-4 m-1``
- ``Sy = 0.05``
- drainage conductance ``= 3e-3 m2/s``
- ``modflow6.tgrid.firstpersteady = false``

``k_2e4`` is only the reference simulation for head-map difference plots. The
stream comparison below always compares each simulated-active network against
the observed ``reference`` hydrographic network.

For a wider sensitivity reading, use :doc:`network-metrics-and-extreme-k-sweep`.
That page adds lower and higher ``K`` values around the present range and keeps
the failed high-``K`` stress case explicit.

Run Command
-----------

From the repository root:

.. code-block:: powershell

   python examples/projects/09_comparison_workflow/run_comparison_example.py --case nancon-seasonal-hydrography-k-sweep-mf6

The run writes results under:

.. code-block:: text

   examples/projects/09_comparison_workflow/outputs/nancon_transient_seasonal_hydrography_wide_k_sweep_mf6/

The main files to inspect are:

- ``simulated_active_network_metrics.csv``
- ``simulated_active_network_overlap_metrics.csv``
- ``simulated_active_network_distance_metrics.csv``
- ``run_figures/<simulation_id>/simulated_active_network_reference_overlay.png``
- ``comparison_report.md``
- ``comparison_audit.md``

After rerunning the workflow, refresh the committed documentation figures with:

.. code-block:: powershell

   python docs/source/theory/streams_and_seepage/diagrams/render_nancon_k_sweep_doc_figures.py --sweep wide

This script reads the CSV exports above and regenerates both the annotated
overlay figures and the metric-evolution graph. The metric values shown below
therefore come from the workflow outputs, not from hand-edited image labels.

Overlap Metrics
---------------

The table below compares the simulated active network of each simulation against
the observed ``reference`` linework. The mode is ``persistent`` because this is
a transient run; cells active for at least 50% of timesteps are retained.

Planar Distance Metrics

The table below is produced by
``simulated_active_network_distance_metrics.csv``. It is a planar
cell-centroid diagnostic, not the downslope DEM-routing criterion.

What To Read In These Metrics
-----------------------------

- Increasing ``K`` contracts the persistent simulated-active extent: active
  cells decrease from 1173 to 670.
- The contraction reduces extra active cells, but it also misses more of the
  observed reference network.
- Precision stays around 0.61, while coverage drops from 0.430 to 0.249.
- The planar bidirectional distance increases from 200 m to 385 m as the
  simulated active network contracts away from parts of the observed network.
- This confirms the visual effect requested for development: the simulated
  network is much less saturated than the earlier low-K sweep. It also shows
  that matching the observed linework will require a real calibration protocol,
  not only increasing ``K``.

Metric Notation
---------------

The figure band below each map uses the following notation:

- :math:`N_a`: number of persistent simulated-active cells.
- :math:`N_{ref}`: number of cells intersected by the observed ``reference``
  network.
- :math:`N_{ov}`: number of cells that are both simulated-active and
  intersected by the ``reference`` network.
- :math:`N_{miss}`: reference cells not captured by the simulated-active
  network.
- :math:`N_{extra}`: simulated-active cells outside the reference-network
  support.
- :math:`C_{ref}=N_{ov}/N_{ref}`: reference-network coverage.
- :math:`P_a=N_{ov}/N_a`: simulated-active precision.
- :math:`F_1=2 C_{ref} P_a/(C_{ref}+P_a)`: harmonic overlap score.
- :math:`D^{plan}_{s\to o}`: mean planar distance from simulated-active
  cells to the observed ``reference`` network.
- :math:`D^{plan}_{o\to s}`: mean planar distance from observed
  ``reference``-network cells to the simulated-active support.
- :math:`\bar{D}^{plan}`: symmetric mean of the two directional planar
  distances.
- :math:`R_D^{plan}=D^{plan}_{s\to o}/D^{plan}_{o\to s}`:
  planar distance ratio. A value close to 1 means that the two directional
  distances have the same order of magnitude. This is only a planar proxy for
  the article-style optimum, not the downslope criterion itself.

Visual Sweep
------------

Each map below is regenerated by
``render_nancon_k_sweep_doc_figures.py``. The top part is the standard
``simulated_active_network_reference_overlay`` figure. The metric band under
the map is assembled from ``simulated_active_network_overlap_metrics.csv`` and
``simulated_active_network_distance_metrics.csv``.

   Evolution of support size, overlap quality, planar distance metrics, and
   the positive distance ratio :math:`R_D^{plan}` across the completed ``K``
   values. The horizontal reference line marks :math:`R_D^{plan}=1`.

   Tradeoff view: coverage versus precision, then
   :math:`\bar{D}^{plan}` versus :math:`F_1`. Point size is proportional to
   :math:`N_a`.

Current Limitation
------------------

This run is useful for visual development, but the audit is intentionally
strict and reports small mesh differences between simulations. For a clean
K-only protocol, the next step is to freeze and reuse exactly the same mesh
for every simulation, then rerun the same sweep.

The overlap metric is cell-based: it rasterizes the observed ``reference``
linework onto the model mesh and compares it with simulated active cells. The
new distance export adds a second, planar diagnostic based on bidirectional
cell-centroid distances. A future calibration metric should still add the
bidirectional downslope criterion used by :cite:`abherve2023`, where the
simulated seepage network is compared to the observed stream network through
simulated-to-observed and observed-to-simulated flowpath distances.

The current CSVs therefore contain a useful planar distance ratio,
``planar_distance_ratio`` and ``planar_distance_log10_ratio``. They can show
an optimum-like crossing when
:math:`D^{plan}_{s\to o}` decreases while
:math:`D^{plan}_{o\to s}` increases, or conversely. They are not
:math:`r_{optim}` from the article because :math:`r_{optim}` must be computed
from downslope flowpath distances and normalized by the DEM resolution.
