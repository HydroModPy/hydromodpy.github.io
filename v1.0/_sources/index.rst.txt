Welcome to HydroModPy
======================================

.. warning::

   You are reading the HydroModPy **v1.0** documentation, the version described in
   the HESS technical note
   (`preprint <https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2026-868>`_). The ``v1.0`` branch
   is the reference cited by the paper and still receives fixes. For the latest
   development version, see HydroModPy v2 on ``main``:
   https://docs.hydromodpy.fr/main/

HydroModPy was initiated in 2018 to streamline the deployment of hydrological
models in catchments across the crystalline basement regions of Normandy and
Brittany, France. The platform integrates a wide range of open-source packages
(FloPy, WhiteBoxTools, etc.), making them easily accessible and shareable among
scientific communities.

The development of HydroModPy was driven by two primary objectives:

#. First, it automates the extraction and discretization of watersheds from
   Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), while adding essential data available
   (e.g. piezometry, hydrography, geology) from local data to national and
   global databases. This ensures a standardized process for setting up and
   running simulation batches across different watersheds with uniform input
   data.
#. The second goal is to facilitate the visualization and comparison of results
   from the various modeling programs included within the platform. In addition
   to its scientific applications, HydroModPy also serves as a valuable
   educational tool, enabling students and researchers to explore
   hydrogeological modeling in a practical context.

   The need for predictive models increases as the pressure of global change intensifies. Regional-scale modeling of shallow unconfined aquifers (10-100 m depth) remains challenging, especially in complex basement aquifers. Controlled both by topography and geology, groundwater flows are organized from hillslope to catchment scale. It is particularly the case in crystalline regions with low aquifer volumes and wet climates, resulting in significant subsurface-surface interactions with very few information available to constrain models.

   To address this, we present HydroModPy, an application developed in Python as a toolbox for automatic deployment of groundwater flow models. HydroModPy integrates geospatial processing (WhiteBoxTools) with groundwater flow and transport simulation tools (MODFLOW and MODPATH via FloPy). It is designed to call other groundwater flow solvers, facilitate multi-site deployment, integrate pre- and post-processing functions such as catchment extraction from a DEM and an advanced representation of head and flow results. Emphasis is placed on integrating aquifer geometry complexities and hydraulic properties heterogeneity (compartmentalization, exponential decay, implementation of a 3D geological model, etc.).

   HydroModPy's user-friendly Python interface allows for testing and exploring various aquifer models across different geomorphological contexts and recharge conditions. Ongoing improvements include methods for calibrating and estimating hydraulic properties using multiple datasets such as hydrographic network maps, streamflow, and piezometric level data. HydroModPy is developed as an open-source toolkit. It is currently being used in climate change effects on groundwater-dependent ecosystems and water resource management issues. Collaborative development should enhance the modeling capacity of near-surface aquifers, facilitate their extension to the regional scale for predictive purposes.
