Mesh And Spatial Support
========================

This section groups the theory notes for mesh and spatial support
choices in HydroModPy.

Mesh choice is not only a preprocessing detail. It controls:

- which basin, river, geology, and boundary constraints are honoured;
- how fields are projected to solver cells;
- which numerical method is appropriate;
- whether solver comparisons isolate backend behaviour or mix backend and
  support effects.

Use this section for the concepts. Use the
:doc:`capability-gallery mesh pages </capability_gallery/mesh>` for concrete,
versioned examples and figures.

Scientific Role
---------------

HydroModPy separates the modelling problem into several layers:

.. code-block:: text

   geographic domain
   -> planar support or mesh
   -> vertical representation
   -> field-to-cell transfer
   -> solver-specific discretization
   -> validation or comparison evidence

That separation matters because the same physical question can be interpreted
on different supports:

- a structured ``sgrid`` support for legacy MODFLOW-NWT-style workflows;
- a MODFLOW 6 support that may remain structured or consume a DISV-style
  irregular mesh;
- a triangular finite-volume support used by the Boussinesq backend;
- a saved mesh bundle reused by comparison and gallery workflows.

Representative gallery evidence
--------------------------------

Mesh concepts are easier to read with concrete artifacts next to the text. The
full case pages remain in :doc:`/capability_gallery/mesh`; the figures below
are the minimum evidence to keep in mind while reading this section.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/mesh/mesh_quality_diagnostics_naizin_10km2.png
   :alt: Mesh quality diagnostics on a Naizin support
   :width: 100%

   Mesh quality diagnostics are not decorative. They are the checks that decide
   whether a discretization is acceptable before solver results are trusted.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/mesh/mesh_constraint_balance_scale_ladder.png
   :alt: Mesh constraint balance across catchment scales
   :width: 100%

   Constraint-balance figures show why mesh choices should be discussed as
   modelling assumptions, especially when hydrography, geology, and basin
   boundary constraints compete.

Capability Gallery Contract
---------------------------

The capability gallery should not replace this section. Its role is different:

- it shows versioned mesh bundles and static figures;
- it exposes node, cell, edge, river, geology, and quality summaries;
- it provides reproducible commands and artifact paths;
- it documents what is already available, not the full method rationale.

The scientific mesh pages should explain how to interpret those gallery
artifacts. The gallery pages should link back here when the reader needs the
conceptual background.

Future Evolution
----------------

The current mesh evidence in the documentation is built from static figures
generated alongside each gallery case. Browsing a real triangulation, an
irregular DISV mesh, or a mesh-quality field today still requires opening the
underlying mesh bundle in a desktop tool such as ParaView or Gmsh.

A future iteration could embed an in-browser 3D mesh viewer based on
`vtk-js <https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/>`_ directly in the gallery and
architecture pages. vtk-js can stream a small VTU/VTP serialized mesh into a
WebGL canvas with picking, slicing, and field-by-cell coloring without any
server-side rendering.

This is a deliberate non-goal for the current refactor: the dependency surface
(WebGL bundle, larger asset payloads, longer page-load budget) is out of scope
until analytics confirm that the static figures are no longer enough. If a
prototype lands later, it should remain opt-in (loaded only on the case pages
that explicitly opt into the viewer) and ship a small, redacted mesh per case
rather than the full bundle.
