Unified notation
================

One reference list for every symbol used in the HydroModPy theory
pages. SI units are the default. Per-page math notes link back here
via the labels at the end of each row, so the same variable is never
defined twice.

Time and calibration
--------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 12 18 14 56

   * - Symbol
     - Description
     - SI unit
     - Notes / cross-refs
   * - ``t``
     - Simulation time
     - s
     - Reported in catalog as ISO date when calendar metadata exists.
   * - ``T_sim``
     - Total simulated horizon
     - s
     - Set via ``[simulation.time]``.
   * - ``RMSE``
     - Root-mean-square error of an observable
     - same as observable
     - Default calibration objective.
   * - ``NSE``
     - Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
     - dimensionless
     - Available via ``[calibration.objective]``.
   * - ``KGE``
     - Kling-Gupta efficiency
     - dimensionless
     - Optional alternative to NSE.
   * - ``NSElog``
     - Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency on log-transformed series
     - dimensionless
     - Weights the recessions rather than the peaks. Not to be confused with
       ``transform = "log"``, which takes the logarithm of an already-computed
       cost; the two names look alike and mean unrelated things.
   * - ``D_so``
     - Mean downslope distance from the simulated stream network to the mapped
       one
     - m
     - A tail statistic, not a typical gap: its median is usually zero. See
       :doc:`streams_and_seepage/downslope-distance-calibration`.
   * - ``D_os``
     - Mean downslope distance from the mapped stream network to the simulated
       one
     - m
     - Same page. ``D_so`` large means an excess of simulated stream, ``D_os``
       large a deficit.
   * - ``J``
     - ``|D_so - D_os|``, the calibrated cost
     - m
     - Its zero is the intersection of two curves, not the minimum of a
       distance. The signed residual travels separately, because a root search
       needs its sign.
   * - ``J_signed``
     - ``D_so - D_os``, the residual the root search drives to zero
     - m
     - Positive means an excess of simulated stream, negative a deficit. It
       travels in the trial components and never in the cost, so picking the
       best trial by lowest cost gives the one closest to zero rather than the
       most negative one.
   * - ``Doptim``
     - ``(D_so + D_os) / 2``
     - m
     - A diagnostic. Legitimate as a cost only in the outer loop that picks
       between structures already balanced at ``J = 0``.
   * - ``roptim``
     - ``Doptim / L_ref``
     - dimensionless
     - Validity indicator. It measures agreement, never correctness: measured
       on synthetic truth it improves as the bias worsens, and it improved from
       4.58 to 2.21 on one catchment purely because the grid was coarser. Two
       values from different meshes are not comparable.
   * - ``L_ref``
     - Square root of the median cell area over the catchment
     - m
     - The median and not the mean: a few large buffer cells would otherwise
       set the scale. Declaring ``observed_position_accuracy`` floors it, so
       that refining the mesh stops shrinking the denominator on its own.
   * - ``L_cap``
     - Longest downslope descent to the outlet inside the catchment
     - m
     - The value a cell whose descent never meets its target saturates at.
       Counting it as ``+inf`` makes the mean infinite; dropping it moves the
       support with the calibrated parameter.
   * - ``alpha``
     - Ratio of the mapped network to its own downslope closure
     - dimensionless
     - Measures the agreement between the routing surface and the mapped
       network. Below 0.90, the distances read a dataset disagreement rather
       than hydrogeology.
   * - ``T/R``
     - Transmissivity over recharge
     - m
     - The output to publish. ``K`` inherits the recharge series entirely,
       measured at plus or minus 25 per cent between reanalyses.

Conventions
-----------

- All times in TOML accept SI units (``"3600 s"``, ``"1 h"``,
  ``"0.5 d"``). The Pydantic Pint integration normalises them.
- Lengths default to metres; declarations may override with explicit
  units (``"500 m"``, ``"2 km"``).
- Vector quantities follow the right-hand rule with z pointing up.
- Sign convention: ``Q > 0`` and ``R > 0`` represent flux into the
  aquifer.

For the in-scope backends and what each one represents, see
:doc:`solvers/solver-capability-matrix`.
