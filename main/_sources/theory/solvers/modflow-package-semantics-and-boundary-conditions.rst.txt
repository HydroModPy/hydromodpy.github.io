MODFLOW Package Semantics And Option Selection
==============================================

Purpose
-------

This page explains how HydroModPy currently uses MODFLOW-family packages in
practice.

Its goal is narrower than a full MODFLOW manual and more concrete than a
high-level backend overview:

- identify which MF6 and NWT packages HydroModPy actually assembles,
- explain why those package families are used,
- justify the main project-level option choices against the official MODFLOW
  documentation and the current HydroModPy code path,
- make clear which simplifications belong to HydroModPy rather than to
  MODFLOW itself.

Primary Official Anchors
------------------------

The scientific statements on this page should stay aligned with these primary
references:

- `USGS TM 6-A55, Documentation for the MODFLOW 6 Groundwater Flow Model <https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A55>`_
- `USGS TM 6-A56, Documentation for the XT3D Option in the Node Property Flow Package of MODFLOW 6 <https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/tm6A56>`_
- `MODFLOW 6 Input Guide <https://modflow6.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mf6io.html>`_
- `USGS TM 6-A37, MODFLOW-NWT, A Newton Formulation for MODFLOW-2005 <https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/tm6a37/>`_
- `Online Guide to MODFLOW-NWT <https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow-nwt/MODFLOW-NWT-Guide/index.html>`_

The HydroModPy documentation should synthesize these sources at project level,
not restate them package by package without context.

Current Code Anchors
--------------------

The current public package choices are mainly assembled in the following code
locations:

- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow6/modflow6.py``
- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow6/flow_to_modflow_adapter.py``
- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow6/modflow6_config.py``
- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow_nwt/nwt/nwt_solver.py``
- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow_nwt/nwt/flow_to_modflow_adapter.py``
- ``hydromodpy/solver/modflow_nwt/nwt/nwt_config.py``
- ``hydromodpy/physics/flow/time_forcing.py``
- ``hydromodpy/physics/forcing/time_alignment.py``

These are the code anchors a contributor should read when checking whether the
public scientific page still matches the real package assembly.

Current Public Package Subset
-----------------------------

HydroModPy intentionally uses a compact MODFLOW subset in its public flow path.

   The important documentation boundary is the adapter. Upstream of it,
   HydroModPy stores solver-agnostic scientific intent. Downstream of it, each
   MODFLOW backend receives package-specific payloads and output-control
   requests.

What HydroModPy Is Deliberately Not Claiming
--------------------------------------------

The public path should not be described as if every MODFLOW package family were
already a maintained modelling route.

Today the main public groundwater-flow subset is centred on:

- ``DISV`` / ``DIS``,
- ``NPF`` / ``UPW``,
- ``STO`` or equivalent storage arrays,
- ``RCHA`` / ``RCH``,
- ``EVT``,
- ``CHD``,
- ``DRN``,
- ``WEL``,
- ``OC``.

That means the public scientific docs should stay careful about packages such
as ``RIV``, ``GHB``, ``SFR``, ``UZF``, ``LAK``, or ``DISU``. They may exist in
the MODFLOW family, and some may exist in code discussions or future plans,
but they are not yet the stable public HydroModPy flow narrative.

MODFLOW 6: Option Selection Rationale
-------------------------------------

TDIS
^^^^

HydroModPy builds ``ModflowTdis`` from the canonical launcher time grid rather
than from one backend-private chronology.

Current project choice:

- ``nper`` comes from ``[simulation.time]``,
- ``perioddata`` is built from the resolved period lengths and time-step
  counts,
- ``tsmult`` is currently fixed to ``1.0`` in the MF6 wrapper.

The last point is a HydroModPy simplification, not an MF6 requirement. The
MF6 ``TDIS`` contract allows ``(perlen, nstp, tsmult)`` per period; the
current wrapper simply does not yet expose variable ``tsmult`` in the public
MF6 path.

IMS
^^^

HydroModPy exposes the following main IMS knobs in
``modflow6.runtime``:

- ``mf6_ims_complexity``
- ``mf6_outer_dvclose``
- ``mf6_inner_dvclose``
- ``mf6_outer_maximum``
- ``mf6_inner_maximum``

The code path uses them in ``ModflowIms(...)`` almost directly.

The main project-specific rule is this:

- if XT3D is active and the user requested ``SIMPLE``, HydroModPy upgrades the
  effective complexity to ``COMPLEX``.

This is an inference from the current code and the MF6/XT3D documentation, not
an explicit MF6 mandate. The rationale is that XT3D adds extra coupling terms
and can increase numerical difficulty, so HydroModPy chooses a conservative
solver preset instead of leaving an obviously weak one in place.

DISV
^^^^

HydroModPy currently builds ``ModflowGwfdisv`` even for the structured MF6
path.

That is a HydroModPy architecture choice, not an MF6 constraint. The reason is
to keep one unified ``SolverMesh -> to_disv_kwargs()`` export contract for:

- structured supports,
- runtime irregular supports,
- shared-support comparison workflows.

Scientifically, this keeps the MF6 branch more uniform, but it also means the
project should document clearly when a comparison is:

- backend-only,
- or backend plus discretization-contract change.

IC
^^

Starting heads are built from the process-level initial-condition policy:

- ``top``
- ``bottom``
- ``custom``

This stays intentionally simple. HydroModPy does not currently expose one
advanced public MF6 initial-condition narrative beyond those three policies.

NPF
^^^

The current MF6 ``NPF`` assembly is one of the most important scientific
choices in the project.

HydroModPy currently sets:

- ``icelltype = 1`` for all layers,
- ``k`` from the mapped conductivity field,
- ``k33 = k / vka``,
- optional ``rewet_record`` and ``wetdry``,
- optional ``xt3doptions = ["XT3D"]``,
- ``save_specific_discharge = True``,
- ``save_saturation = True``.

Why these choices make sense:

- ``icelltype``:
  the MF6 documentation says this flag controls whether saturated thickness is
  held constant or varies with head. HydroModPy uses the convertible path
  because its public MF6 use is mainly unconfined or water-table style
  groundwater modelling.
- ``k33 = k / vka``:
  the project exposes one simple vertical-anisotropy control in
  ``modflow6.process_specific.vka`` instead of requiring the user to manage an
  independent full ``k33`` field in the common path.
- rewetting:
  MF6 ``REWET`` is off by default in the official package, and HydroModPy keeps
  it disabled unless explicitly enabled through ``mf6_enable_rewet``. That is a
  deliberate conservative choice: rewetting changes the nonlinear behaviour and
  should remain visible.
- XT3D:
  the official docs present XT3D as more expensive but more accurate for
  anisotropic conductivity and irregular grids. HydroModPy therefore auto-
  enables XT3D on unstructured meshes unless the user overrides the choice.
- ``save_specific_discharge`` and ``save_saturation``:
  these are project-facing diagnostics choices. HydroModPy uses them because
  postprocessing, interpretation, and comparison artifacts benefit directly
  from those outputs.

HydroModPy does not currently activate many other available ``NPF`` options
such as ``VARIABLECV``, ``PERCHED``, or alternative cell averaging in the
public path. That absence should be documented honestly rather than left
implicit.

STO
^^^

HydroModPy currently builds ``STO`` with:

- ``sy``
- ``ss``
- ``iconvert = 1`` for all layers
- one per-period steady/transient map derived from the time grid

The official ``STO`` documentation distinguishes:

- ``ICONVERT``
- ``SS``
- ``SY``
- period ``STEADY-STATE`` / ``TRANSIENT`` flags

HydroModPy keeps the interpretation simple:

- ``SS`` is treated as specific storage, not storage coefficient,
- ``SY`` is retained as the unconfined drainable storage term,
- every layer is treated through the convertible path,
- the stress-period flags are driven from the launcher-level time definition.

That means HydroModPy does not currently expose ``STORAGECOEFFICIENT`` or
``SS_CONFINED_ONLY`` as part of its public MF6 contract.

RCHA
^^^^

HydroModPy currently uses ``ModflowGwfrcha`` instead of the list-style ``RCH``
package.

This choice is well aligned with the way the code works:

- forcing is resolved to one value per stress period,
- heterogeneous forcing is discretized to one value per cell,
- the resulting natural internal representation is an array, not a sparse list
  of recharge cells.

The official ``RCHA`` documentation explicitly defines the array-based
``READASARRAYS`` path, which matches HydroModPy well.

HydroModPy also adds an auxiliary ``CONCENTRATION`` slot on ``RCHA``. That is a
project choice made for the current MF6-GWT coupling path, not a groundwater-
flow necessity.

EVT
^^^

HydroModPy builds ``EVT`` only when one of these is true:

- explicit ETP forcing exists,
- negative recharge is rerouted to evapotranspiration.

The project currently feeds the package with the simple
``cellid, surface, rate, depth`` structure rather than with more advanced
piecewise extinction options.

The important HydroModPy choices are:

- surface elevation is taken from topography minus one configured offset,
- extinction depth is one explicit runtime parameter,
- stream and ocean support cells are excluded from the current public EVT path.

This is a reasonable compact contract, but it is not yet a full public theory
of land-surface evapotranspiration.

CHD, DRN, WEL, and OC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: /_static/theory/modflow/modflow_boundary_semantics.svg
   :alt: MODFLOW boundary and forcing semantics for RCH EVT DRN CHD and WEL
   :width: 100%

   The current public path deliberately separates diffuse forcing, atmospheric
   extraction, imposed-head supports, head-dependent drainage, and localized
   wells. This matters when comparing basin studies because equal-looking
   map overlays may come from different physical boundary semantics.

HydroModPy currently makes the following public choices:

- ``CHD``:
  used for side, stream, and ocean stage-style boundaries.
- ``DRN``:
  used for head-dependent drainage or seepage-style release.
- ``WEL``:
  used for wells resolved late from process-level declarations to solver-cell
  addresses.
- ``OC``:
  configured to save heads and budgets systematically.

The strongest scientific caveat is on ``CHD``:

- using ``CHD`` for stream or ocean means the public path is stage-controlled
  and imposed-head based,
- not a full ``RIV`` or ``GHB`` conductance law.

That simplification is currently part of HydroModPy's public scientific
contract and should be reported explicitly in comparison or basin-study pages.

MODFLOW-NWT: Option Selection Rationale
---------------------------------------

NWT solver package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HydroModPy exposes the main Newton-solver fields under
``modflownwt.runtime.nwt``:

- ``headtol``
- ``fluxtol``
- ``maxiterout``
- ``thickfact``
- ``linmeth``
- ``ibotav``
- ``options``
- ``continue_run``
- ``backflag``
- ``stoptol``

The official NWT guide explains that ``OPTIONS`` may be ``SIMPLE``,
``MODERATE``, ``COMPLEX``, or ``SPECIFIED``. HydroModPy currently defaults to
``COMPLEX`` in the validated config, which is a conservative project choice
suited to the fact that the public NWT path is mainly kept for structured,
unconfined, and comparison-oriented cases rather than only for nearly linear
confined benchmarks.

HydroModPy should not overclaim these defaults as universally optimal. Several
NWT parameters, especially ``IBOTAV`` and the nonlinear-control family, remain
problem-specific and are correctly exposed as expert settings rather than hard
scientific truths.

DIS and BAS
^^^^^^^^^^^

The NWT branch stays on the structured grid path:

- structured solver mesh only,
- ``ModflowDis`` for geometry and time metadata,
- ``ModflowBas`` for ``ibound`` and starting heads.

This is a deliberate HydroModPy split:

- MF6 carries the modern unified mesh route,
- NWT remains the historical structured baseline.

UPW
^^^

The official NWT report states that MODFLOW-NWT must be used with the
Upstream-Weighting package.

That is why HydroModPy does not present ``LPF`` or ``HUF`` as alternate public
NWT flow paths. The NWT branch is intentionally a ``UPW`` branch.

HydroModPy currently sets:

- ``laytype = 1`` for all layers,
- ``laywet = 0`` for all layers,
- ``hk``
- ``sy``
- ``ss``
- ``vka`` from ``modflownwt.process_specific.vka``
- ``iphdry``
- ``hdry``
- ``layvka``

The official UPW guide explains that:

- ``LAYVKA`` controls whether ``VKA`` is interpreted as vertical hydraulic
  conductivity or as the horizontal-to-vertical ratio,
- ``IPHDRY`` controls whether dry-cell heads are written as ``HDRY``,
- ``HDRY`` is mainly an output indicator rather than a governing parameter.

This aligns well with the HydroModPy contract:

- one compact anisotropy control ``vka``,
- one explicit ``layvka`` interpretation flag,
- one explicit dry-cell output policy through ``iphdry`` and ``hdry``.

Recharge, EVT, DRN, WEL, and OC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current NWT branch mirrors the same broad semantic logic as MF6:

- ``RCH`` for diffuse recharge,
- ``EVT`` for explicit ETP or negative-recharge rerouting,
- ``DRN`` for head-dependent drainage,
- ``WEL`` for pumping or injection,
- ``CHD`` for imposed-head boundaries,
- ``OC`` for systematic head and budget outputs.

Two extra points matter scientifically:

- rate payloads are converted from SI to solver time units using ``ITMUNI``,
  so the unit bridge should remain explicit in the docs;
- ``RCH`` and ``EVT`` are still fed from the same upstream forcing semantics as
  MF6, even though the package syntax differs.

HydroModPy-Specific Simplifications To Keep Explicit
----------------------------------------------------

The following are project-level simplifications and should not be mistaken for
generic MODFLOW truths:

- stream and ocean are currently mostly public ``CHD`` paths, not full
  ``RIV`` or ``GHB`` laws;
- MF6 uses ``DISV`` as the unified geometry export path, even for structured
  supports;
- MF6 currently keeps ``tsmult = 1.0`` in ``TDIS`` in the public wrapper;
- the common MF6 path uses one simple ``k33 = k / vka`` rule rather than a
  fully independent 3D conductivity tensor description;
- NWT remains intentionally tied to ``UPW`` and the structured-grid branch.

What Should Be Reported In A Methods Section
--------------------------------------------

If one HydroModPy study relies on a MODFLOW backend, its methods section should
normally state:

- backend family: ``modflow6`` or ``modflow_nwt``,
- geometry contract: structured ``DIS`` or unified ``DISV`` path,
- whether XT3D is active,
- whether rewetting is active,
- whether stream or ocean boundaries are currently represented as imposed-head
  supports,
- how recharge and ETP were aggregated to stress periods,
- whether ``first_clim`` overrides period 0,
- whether ``vka`` is used as an anisotropy ratio or direct vertical
  conductivity control.

Without that information, many apparent solver differences remain ambiguous.

Current Limitation
------------------

This page now explains the current public package subset and the main option
choices, but it still does not replace:

- the full official MODFLOW package manuals,
- a future page on the exact MF6/NWT forcing-to-package payload examples,
- or one future worked example that follows a full HydroModPy case from TOML to
  final package files.
