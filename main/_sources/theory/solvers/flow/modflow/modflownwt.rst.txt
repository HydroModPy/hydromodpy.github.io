MODFLOW-NWT Flow
================

This page groups scientific reading for ``flow/modflow_nwt``.

Use this path when the study needs continuity with legacy structured-grid
MODFLOW-NWT workflows or downstream ``transport/modpath`` and
``transport/mt3dms`` compatibility.

What Is Repeated From The Common MODFLOW Part
---------------------------------------------

``flow/modflow_nwt`` still uses the common MODFLOW-family contract:

- hydraulic head is the primary groundwater-flow state;
- recharge, wells, storage, imposed heads, and drainage are normalized by the
  HydroModPy ``Flow`` layer before backend assembly;
- stress periods carry the time discretization seen by the backend;
- package semantics must be documented before interpreting a result;
- comparison against another backend requires checking mesh, vertical
  representation, forcing aggregation, and boundary-condition mapping.

This repetition is intentional. The MODFLOW-NWT page should be readable
without first opening the MODFLOW 6 page.

Typical Use Cases
-----------------

Use ``flow/modflow_nwt`` when:

- the study is structured-grid only;
- the target is continuity with an older MODFLOW-NWT workflow;
- downstream particle tracking should use MODPATH;
- downstream concentration transport should use MT3DMS;
- a comparison needs a legacy MODFLOW-family baseline.

Be explicit when:

- the same physical case is also run with MODFLOW 6;
- MODFLOW 6 uses a different grid topology or XT3D setting;
- observations or validation profiles are compared after spatial aggregation;
- transport results depend on this upstream flow field.

Surface-Seepage Baseline Example
--------------------------------

For this work, the most useful MODFLOW-NWT example is the committed Nancon
transient basin page:

- :doc:`/capability_gallery/cases/nancon_transient_nwt`

Use it as a legacy baseline because it already places the important evidence in
one reading sequence:

1. hydrographic ``reference`` versus ``generated`` linework;
2. simulated active-network overlay against ``reference``;
3. piezometric map;
4. hydrograph;
5. water budget.

   :alt: Piezometric map from the Nancon MODFLOW-NWT run
   :width: 100%

   The piezometric map is the first state figure for this legacy structured
   MODFLOW-NWT baseline.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/nancon_transient_nwt_hydrograph.png
   :alt: Hydrograph from the Nancon MODFLOW-NWT run
   :width: 100%

   The hydrograph connects the structured-grid solve to observed discharge at
   basin scale.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/simulation/nancon_transient_nwt_water_budget.png

   :width: 100%

   The budget is where recharge, ET, storage, and drainage package behaviour
   should be checked before drawing conclusions from one map.

That is the discipline to preserve when comparing with MODFLOW 6. Copy the
scientific reading order, not every backend assumption. MODFLOW-NWT remains
structured-grid and legacy-package oriented, while MODFLOW 6 must also document
mesh topology, package extraction, and active-network result fields.

For the cross-backend examples and commands, see
:doc:`../../../streams_and_seepage/worked-examples`. For current contracts and
non-contracts around simulated active networks, see
:doc:`../../../streams_and_seepage/status-and-limitations`.

Scientific Checklist

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Decision point
     - What to document
   * - Grid support
     - Structured ``sgrid`` support.
   * - Legacy continuity
     - Whether the run is intended to reproduce or compare with older
       MODFLOW-NWT studies.
   * - Package envelope
     - Which recharge, well, storage, and boundary-condition packages are
       assembled.
   * - Comparison target
     - Whether the run is compared to MODFLOW 6, Boussinesq, an analytical
       case, or field observations.
   * - Transport coupling
     - Whether the flow run must feed ``transport/modpath`` or
       ``transport/mt3dms``.

Minimal Plan Shape
------------------

.. code-block:: toml

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "flow_main"
   type = "flow"
   solvers = ["modflow_nwt"]

   [solver]
   backend = { backend = "modflow_nwt" }

Minimal Process Interpretation
------------------------------

The short TOML shape above means:

- one ``flow`` process is requested;
- the selected solver name is ``modflow_nwt``;
- HydroModPy resolves common ``Flow`` inputs to the MODFLOW-NWT route;
- the final scientific interpretation depends on structured support, package
  choices, stress periods, and downstream legacy transport needs.
