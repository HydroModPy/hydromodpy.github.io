Custom Data
===========

Use ``source = "custom"`` when project-owned data should be authoritative. This
is common for production studies, teaching material, offline CI, and cases where
public providers are incomplete or too volatile.

Path resolution
---------------

Relative ``path`` and ``mask_path`` values are resolved from the TOML file. For
typed data sections, bare filenames can also be resolved against the workspace
``data/`` folder and the matching ``data/<family>/`` folder.

.. code-block:: toml

   [data]
   project_crs = "EPSG:2154"
   types = ["dem", "geology", "hydrometry", "recharge"]

   [[data.dem.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/dem/catchment_dem.tif"

Local rasters and grids
-----------------------

Custom gridded climate and hydrological inputs can be read from NetCDF or
GeoTIFF files. NetCDF time dimensions are sliced to the project period when a
period is available.

.. code-block:: toml

   [data.recharge]
   date_start = "2000-01-01"
   date_end = "2002-12-31"

   [[data.recharge.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/recharge/recharge_daily.nc"
   source_unit = "mm/day"

Set ``source_unit`` when the file metadata is absent, ambiguous, or not the
unit expected by HydroModPy. This is safer than compensating later in solver
parameters.

DEM custom inputs use the DEM loader and can read common raster formats used by
the DEM manager:

.. code-block:: toml

   [[data.dem.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/dem/local_dem.tif"
   mask_path = "data/masks/watershed.gpkg"

The expected output is the same kind of basin-support panel as for public
providers: a readable DEM, a coherent watershed boundary, and no CRS surprise.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_identity_card_map_dem.png

   :width: 100%

   A custom DEM should make this support check boring. If the basin appears
   shifted, cropped, inverted, or empty, fix the local file metadata before
   changing solver settings.

   :width: 100%

   The generated local example shows the same custom-data principle on a
   smaller support: the raster and vector layers must agree spatially before
   any downstream workflow trusts them.

Local vectors
-------------

Custom geology vectors need a field that carries the geology code:

.. code-block:: toml

   [[data.geology.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/geology/geology.gpkg"
   code_field = "CODE_LEG"
   values_table_path = "data/geology/hydraulic_properties.csv"

The rendered geology panel should expose both the spatial units and their
legend. The important check is that the geology code used by ``code_field`` is
still interpretable after loading, clipping, reprojection, and optional joining
with the hydraulic-property table.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_identity_card_map_geology.png
   :alt: Geology panel with legend used as the visual contract for custom geology data
   :width: 100%

   A custom geology layer is ready to drive supports, zones, or hydraulic
   parameters only when the displayed polygons and legend are readable
   together. Missing labels, collapsed categories, or unexpected empty zones
   usually point to a ``code_field`` mismatch, a failed attribute join, or a CRS
   issue in the source vector.

Custom hydrography can point to a local river-network vector:

.. code-block:: toml

   [[data.hydrography.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/hydrography/rivers.gpkg"
   rasterize_field = "FID"

For local hydrography, the visual contract is the same as for BD Topage or OSM:
the loaded river layer must make sense on the basin support.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_identity_card_map_hydrography.png
   :alt: Hydrography panel used as the visual contract for custom river data
   :width: 100%

   Custom river data is authoritative only after it has passed this spatial
   check. A correct file path is not enough.

.. figure:: /_static/user_guide/data/geology_property_brittany_local.png
   :alt: Local custom geology property transfer example
   :width: 100%

   Local vector data can also become model-facing parameters. Here the geology
   code joins to a ``K`` table, then the result is transferred to a mesh field.

Local point and time-series folders
-----------------------------------

Point/time-series custom sources use a directory convention:

.. code-block:: text

   data/hydrometry/
   |-- hydrometry_custom_LOC.csv
   |-- hydrometry_custom_J1234010_20000101_20021231_D.csv
   `-- hydrometry_custom_J1234020_20000101_20021231_D.csv

The location file defaults are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 78

   * - Column
     - Meaning
   * - ``id``
     - Station identifier used to find chronicle files.
   * - ``x``, ``y``
     - Station coordinates.
   * - ``crs``
     - Optional CRS per station. ``default_crs`` is used when the column is
       missing.
   * - ``unit``
     - Source unit for point records when the family requires unit conversion.

Chronicle CSV defaults are ``datetime`` and ``value``. Rename columns in TOML
instead of reshaping source files:

.. code-block:: toml

   [data.hydrometry]
   date_start = "2000-01-01"
   date_end = "2002-12-31"

   [[data.hydrometry.sources]]
   source = "custom"
   path = "data/hydrometry"
   col_id = "station"
   col_x = "lon"
   col_y = "lat"
   default_crs = "EPSG:4326"
   col_datetime = "date"
   col_value = "Q"
   station_ids = ["J1234010"]

.. figure:: /_static/user_guide/data/observations_local_timeseries_examples.png
   :alt: Local custom observation chronicles
   :width: 100%

   The same directory convention can carry discharge, groundwater level, or
   chemistry. The chronicle figure is where units, gaps, and temporal coverage
   become visible.

The overview panels should then show both the selected stations and the
chronicles that were actually ingested.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_nancon_timeseries_discharge.png
   :alt: Discharge chronicle panel used as the visual contract for custom hydrometry
   :width: 100%

   For custom time series, the most useful check is not the filename convention
   itself but the rendered chronology: dates, gaps, units, and station identity
   must be visible before a solver or calibration run reuses the data.

Controlled sources
------------------

Some sources are local by design even when they do not read a file.

.. code-block:: toml

   [data.oceanic]
   date_start = "2020-01-01"
   date_end = "2020-12-31"

   [[data.oceanic.sources]]
   source = "constant"
   value = 0.0

   [data.recharge]
   date_start = "2020-01-01"
   date_end = "2020-01-31"

   [[data.recharge.sources]]
   source = "synthetic"
   values = [0.8, 1.2, 0.6]

Use constants and synthetic forcing for tests, tutorials, and controlled
diagnostics. Use custom files when the goal is to reproduce a production data
set.
