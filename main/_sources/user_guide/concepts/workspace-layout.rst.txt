Workspace layout
================

HydroModPy nests three levels: **workspace** > **project** > **run**.

- The **workspace** owns the shared input-data cache. Several projects on
  the same geographic area reuse it instead of downloading twice.
- The **project** owns everything else: its configurations, its runs, its
  calibration sessions, its exports, and the index over them. It is
  anchored by ``project.toml``.
- The **run** is one directory under ``runs/``, named after the run.

   The workspace separates cached inputs from project-owned results. That
   separation is what keeps repeated workflows inspectable instead of
   turning one folder into an output dump.

A workspace is optional. A project directory holding a ``project.toml``
works on its own; it simply keeps its own ``data/`` cache instead of
sharing one.

               └── trash/            quarantined orphan stores

One run directory:

.. code-block:: text

   runs/<name>/
   ├── config.toml         frozen resolved configuration
   ├── fields.zarr/        array store
   ├── tables.parquet/     one Parquet file per tabular payload
   ├── figures/            figures rendered for this run
   ├── manifest.json       seal, written last
   ├── provenance.json     versions, git commit, solver binary
   ├── annotations.json    tags and notes, written after the seal
   └── trash.json          present only while the run sits in the trash

``runs/``, ``sessions/`` and ``share/`` are git-ignored by the scaffolded
``.gitignore``, together with ``.hmp/``.

Reserved directory names
------------------------

Every name above is declared once, in
:mod:`hydromodpy.core.state.paths`. The names of the files *inside* a run
belong to :mod:`hydromodpy.results.storage.contract`. Do not create your
own ``runs/``, ``sessions/``, ``share/`` or ``.hmp/`` entries by hand: the
index rebuild reads them as HydroModPy output.

Scaffolding
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp workspace init ~/hmp_workspace
   hmp project new my_basin --workspace ~/hmp_workspace

``hmp workspace init`` writes ``workspace.toml``, the ``data/<variable>/``
folders with their README and example files, and a ready-to-run
``projects/example/``. ``hmp project new`` writes ``project.toml``,
``run_demo.toml`` and a ``.gitignore``. No index database is created at
that point: the first run creates it.

Path resolution
---------------

Given a config TOML, HydroModPy resolves the **shared data workspace** in
this order, first match wins:

1. **Explicit.** The TOML declares ``root`` or ``data_dir`` under
   ``[workspace]``.

   .. code-block:: toml

      [workspace]
      project_root = "."
      root = "/path/to/workspace"
      # per-component overrides:
      # data_dir = "/path/to/workspace/data"
      # catalog_path = "/path/to/my_basin/.hmp/index.duckdb"
      # runs_dir = "/path/to/my_basin/runs"
      # output_root = "/scratch/my_basin"   # redirects .hmp/scratch and share/

2. **Environment.** ``HMP_WORKSPACE`` points at a directory.

3. **Scaffold.** The project sits at ``<workspace>/projects/<name>/`` and
   ``<workspace>/data/`` exists.

4. **Standalone project.** Nothing else matched: the project directory is
   its own data workspace, so ``data/`` is created next to ``project.toml``.

Results never follow that resolution. They are project-local by
construction: ``catalog_path`` defaults to
``<project_root>/.hmp/index.duckdb`` and ``runs_dir`` to
``<project_root>/runs``.

The keys accepted under ``[workspace]`` are exactly ``project_root``
(required), ``root``, ``catalog_path``, ``data_dir``, ``runs_dir`` and
``output_root``. Any other key is rejected: the configuration model sets
``extra="forbid"``.

The project root itself is found by walking up from the config file to the
first directory holding ``project.toml``. The marker is the config file,
never a database file, because the index may be absent.

Diagnosing the resolution
-------------------------

``hmp doctor --toml`` reports which branch produced the workspace and the
resolved paths:

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp doctor --toml ~/hmp_workspace/projects/my_basin/run_demo.toml

.. code-block:: text

   OK     workspace                    resolved via scaffold
   OK     workspace_root               /home/bb/hmp_workspace
   OK     catalog_path                 /home/bb/hmp_workspace/projects/my_basin/.hmp/index.duckdb
   OK     data_dir                     /home/bb/hmp_workspace/data
   OK     runs_dir                     /home/bb/hmp_workspace/projects/my_basin/runs
   OK     results:layout               1 index row(s), 1 run director(y|ies)

The ``workspace`` line names the branch that fired: ``explicit``, ``env``,
``scaffold`` or ``project``. The ``results:layout`` line compares the index
row count with the number of run directories on disk; a mismatch is the
signal to run ``hmp catalog reindex``.

The same command also checks the Python version, the heavy dependencies and
the solver binaries, so it is the first thing to run when something breaks.

Machine-wide index
------------------

A separate DuckDB file under ``$XDG_STATE_HOME/hydromodpy/index.duckdb``
federates the **projects** registered on the machine, for cross-project
discovery. One row is one project root, the directory holding
``project.toml`` and its ``.hmp/index.duckdb``, because that index file is
what the federation attaches. A workspace root has none of its own, so
registering one adds the project roots under its ``projects/`` directory,
one row each, and a workspace with no project yet adds nothing. The file
is fully recreatable from the registered projects and is operated by
``hmp workspace register``, ``hmp workspace search``,
``hmp workspace forget`` and ``hmp workspace prune``.

Two environment variables relocate the machine-wide directories:
``HMP_STATE_HOME`` for the state directory (global index) and
``HMP_CACHE_HOME`` for the cache directory (solver binaries under
``bin/``). ``HMP_BIN`` overrides the binary directory alone. None of them
patches a configuration field.

Where to look next

- :doc:`project-vs-run` for the project versus run distinction.
- :doc:`../results-and-exports` for reading each artefact of a run.
- :doc:`/architecture/storage-layout` for the storage contract itself.
