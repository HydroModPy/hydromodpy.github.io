Testbed Workflow
================

Use this workflow when the goal is not to run one model, but to organize a
controlled method testbed.

A testbed expands cases, delegates each case to a child runner, then
collects evidence artifacts such as generated configs, metrics, manifests, and
reports.

   :align: center

   ``testbed`` owns the case matrix and evidence contract. Mesh, flow, and
   future transport runners keep ownership of their own domain execution.

The first supported subjects are:

- ``mesh`` through the ``simulation`` runner with a ``type = "mesh"``
  process;
- ``flow`` through either the ``simulation`` runner or the ``comparison``
  runner.
- ``transport`` through the same child-runner contract as flow.

This keeps the testbed detached from simulation internals. A mesh testbed can
evaluate discretization choices without running a flow solver. A flow testbed
delegates to ordinary generated ``[workflow].mode = "simulation"`` children,
but the testbed itself only expands cases and gathers evidence. A flow
testbed can also delegate to ordinary generated
``[workflow].mode = "comparison"`` children when a regional or method campaign
contains several pairwise comparison configs.

The implementation lives near the analysis workflows in
``hydromodpy/analysis/testbed/``. The package README documents the internal
contract for maintainers; this page documents the user-facing behavior.

Profiles
--------

``[testbed].profile`` selects a specialization of the testbed campaign model.
When omitted, the profile is ``"generic"`` and the file is parsed as the
case matrix documented on this page.

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "testbed"

   [testbed]
   profile = "generic"

``profile = "regional_lab"`` delegates to the regional catalog profile. That
profile exposes the ``[regional_lab]`` section for regional concepts such as
site catalogs, cluster rules, status/maturity fields, coverage gaps, and
recipes. See :doc:`regional_lab` for the full reference.

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "testbed"

   [testbed]
   profile = "regional_lab"

   [regional_lab]
   lab_id = "headwater_campaign"

What This Workflow Is
---------------------

Declare a testbed with:

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "testbed"

   [testbed]
   id = "mesh_resolution_testbed"
   subject = "mesh"
   purpose = "robustness"
   base_config = "mesh_base.toml"
   output_root = "outputs/mesh_resolution_testbed"

   [testbed.runner]
   type = "simulation"

   [[testbed.case]]
   id = "coarse"
   axis = "resolution"

   [testbed.case.overlay.mesh_catchment.zone_meshing]
   global_size = 400.0

   [[testbed.case]]
   id = "fine"
   axis = "resolution"

   [testbed.case.overlay.mesh_catchment.zone_meshing]
   global_size = 100.0

   [[testbed.metric]]
   name = "n_cells"

The launcher writes one child TOML per case under:

.. code-block:: text

   <output_root>/_generated_configs/

For mesh subjects, each generated child is a normal
``[workflow].mode = "simulation"`` TOML. If the base config does not already
declare processes, the testbed materializer injects:

.. code-block:: toml

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "mesh_main"
   type = "mesh"
   backend = "catchment"

``runner.type = "mesh_catchment"`` is no longer part of the testbed contract.
Use ``runner.type = "simulation"`` and keep mesh settings in the
``[mesh_catchment]`` section consumed by the mesh process.

Compatibility Note
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``case`` is the canonical testbed vocabulary. The historical TOML spellings
``[[testbed.variant]]`` and ``[[testbed.variant_from_catalog]]`` are no longer
accepted. Use ``[[testbed.case]]`` and ``[[testbed.case_from_catalog]]``.

Catalog-Backed Cases
--------------------

Cases can also be generated from a CSV or JSONL catalog. This is the common
campaign model that the ``regional_lab`` profile specializes for regional site
inventories.

.. code-block:: toml

   [testbed.catalog]
   path = "case_catalog.jsonl"
   format = "jsonl"
   id_field = "case_id"
   label_field = "title"
   axis_field = "scale"
   tags_field = "tags"
   path_fields = ["workspace_root"]
   field_equals = { tier = "smoke" }
   tags = ["mesh_ready"]

   [[testbed.case_from_catalog]]
   required_fields = ["workspace_root", "global_size"]

   [testbed.case_from_catalog.overlay.workspace]
   project_root = "{workspace_root}"

   [testbed.case_from_catalog.overlay.mesh_catchment.zone_meshing]
   global_size = "{global_size}"

The catalog loader supports CSV and JSONL, optional suffix inference with
``format = "auto"``, required fields, path fields resolved relative to the
catalog file, tag filtering, equality filters, and ``enabled`` rows. The
``case_from_catalog`` block is an overlay template: placeholders such as
``{workspace_root}`` and ``{global_size}`` are taken from the selected row.
Explicit ``[[testbed.case]]`` blocks and catalog-generated cases can be
combined as long as case identifiers remain unique.

Catalog-Backed Comparisons
--------------------------

The same mechanism can generate one comparison per site. In that case the
testbed child is a normal ``[workflow].mode = "comparison"`` TOML, not a special
script:

.. code-block:: toml

   [testbed]
   subject = "flow"
   base_config = "compare_natural_10km2_mf6_bouss_base.toml"

   [testbed.runner]
   type = "comparison"

   [testbed.catalog]
   path = "natural_10km2_sites.csv"
   id_field = "site_id"
   label_field = "site_label"
   tags_field = "tags"
   tags = ["natural_10km2", "comparison"]

   [[testbed.case_from_catalog]]
   id_template = "{site_id}"

   [testbed.case_from_catalog.overlay.comparison]
   comparison_id = "{site_id}_natural_10km2_mf6_bouss"
   output_root = "outputs/comparisons/{site_id}_natural_10km2_mf6_bouss"

   [testbed.case_from_catalog.overlay.comparison.base_simulation_overlay.geographic.catchment]
   x_outlet = "{x_outlet}"
   y_outlet = "{y_outlet}"

The generated comparison config still delegates to the existing comparison
launcher. ``comparison.base_simulation_overlay`` carries the site-wide physical
case shared by all methods in that comparison, while each
``comparison.simulation.overlay`` keeps method-specific settings such as MF6 IMS
parameters or the Boussinesq PETSc TS/SNESVI backend.

For comparison testbeds, ``[[testbed.metric]]`` is optional. If no metric block
is declared, the runner reports the default comparison summary: comparison id,
audit status, row counts, and numerical-closure diagnostics when available.
Declare explicit metric blocks only when the campaign needs a custom summary.

The HTML synthesis generated by
``examples/projects/10_testbed_workflow/reporting/generate_testbed_web_report.py``
detects this catalog contract from the testbed manifest and adds a
``Mode catalogue pas a pas`` section with links to the catalog, generated
configs, and comparison pages.

Flow Example
------------

A flow testbed uses the same orchestration contract, but delegates each child
case to the simulation workflow:

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "testbed"

   [testbed]
   id = "flow_k_sensitivity"
   subject = "flow"
   purpose = "robustness"
   base_config = "flow_base.toml"
   output_root = "outputs/flow_k_sensitivity"

   [testbed.runner]
   type = "simulation"

   [[testbed.case]]
   id = "low_k"
   axis = "hydraulic_conductivity"

   [testbed.case.overlay.simulation]
   name = "flow_low_k"

   [testbed.case.overlay.flow.param.K.field]
   value = "5e-6 m/s"

   [[testbed.case]]
   id = "high_k"
   axis = "hydraulic_conductivity"

   [testbed.case.overlay.simulation]
   name = "flow_high_k"

   [testbed.case.overlay.flow.param.K.field]
   value = "2e-5 m/s"

   [[testbed.metric]]
   name = "duration_s"
   source = "flow_metrics.duration_s"

   [[testbed.metric]]
   name = "max_abs_balance_error"
   source = "flow_metrics.max_abs_mass_balance_percent_error"

   [[testbed.metric]]
   name = "head_range_m"
   source = "flow_metrics.head_range_m"

Here ``flow_base.toml`` is a normal ``[workflow].mode = "simulation"`` TOML. The
testbed declaration stays outside that base file, so the generated child
configs remain valid simulation configs. This is the important boundary:
``testbed`` owns the experimental matrix; ``simulation`` owns physical
execution.

For flow children, the launcher tries to reopen the generated run through the
``Catalog`` and enriches the child summary with:

- ``catalog``: run metadata such as solver, status, duration, cell count, and
  time-step count;
- ``parameters``: scalar persisted parameters;
- ``budget``: component-wise total inflow, outflow, and net flow;
- ``mass_balance`` indicators under ``flow_metrics``;
- ``field_summary`` and flat ``flow_metrics`` entries for persisted fields such
  as ``head``, ``watertable_depth``, ``outflow_drain``, and
  ``accumulation_flux`` when they are available.

Metric sources use dot paths into that summary. For example:
``flow_metrics.param_K``, ``flow_metrics.budget_<component>_total_out``, or
``flow_metrics.head_range_m``. The exact budget component name comes from the
solver result catalog, for example ``chd`` for prescribed-head exchanges.

The repository flow starter in
``examples/projects/10_testbed_workflow/flow_k_sensitivity_testbed.toml`` has
been smoke-tested with one executed MODFLOW 6 child. In that case, prescribed
heads are exposed as ``flow_metrics.budget_chd_total_out`` and recharge as
``flow_metrics.budget_rcha_total_in``. The example marks its key metrics as
``required = true`` so switching from ``execute = false`` to ``execute = true``
fails loudly if the catalog cannot provide the expected evidence.

The full three-case matrix was also executed locally with ``execute = true``.
All children completed successfully with 547 cells and zero mass-balance
percent error:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 18 18 18 22 24

   * - Case
     - ``param_K``
     - ``n_cells``
     - ``head_range_m``
     - ``prescribed_head_out``
   * - ``low_k``
     - ``5e-06``
     - ``547``
     - ``61.95``
     - ``0.05158187``
   * - ``reference_k``
     - ``1e-05``
     - ``547``
     - ``47.55``
     - ``0.05158152``
   * - ``high_k``
     - ``2e-05``
     - ``547``
     - ``40.91``
     - ``0.05158121``

These values are not committed as generated outputs; they document the current
smoke-tested behavior of the starter configuration.

Runnable Example Files
----------------------

The repository contains two starter testbeds:

- ``examples/projects/10_testbed_workflow/mesh_resolution_testbed.toml``;
- ``examples/projects/10_testbed_workflow/flow_k_sensitivity_testbed.toml``.

Both use ``execute = false`` so they first materialize generated child configs
without spending solver time. Change that flag to ``true`` when the matrix has
the intended cases.

Mesh As A Testbed Subject
-------------------------

Mesh work is documented here rather than as a separate top-level user guide
workflow. The user-facing question is usually not "build one mesh", but "how
stable is the discretization choice?"

For mesh studies, ``testbed`` answers:
"Run this controlled set of mesh cases and collect evidence."

This means:

- use ``subject = "mesh"`` with ``runner.type = "simulation"`` for
  resolution ladders, constraint sensitivity, conformity studies, and
  robustness checks;
- describe mesh-only children with ``[[simulation.process]]`` /
  ``type = "mesh"`` instead of a separate mesh workflow;
- keep mono-case mesh artifacts as generated evidence inside the testbed output
  tree;
- use ``flow`` testbeds when the varied axis is solver settings, flow
  parameters, forcing choices, or boundary-condition alternatives;
- keep future transport subjects inside the same testbed contract instead of
  creating a new workflow name for each method family.

Mesh Decision Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mesh controls numerical sensitivity, solver compatibility (structured
``sgrid`` vs unstructured DISV), local refinement around stream networks and
zone interfaces, and the cell budget that calibration loops will pay for. Use
the following routing when a question about discretization comes up:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 62

   * - Question
     - Best entry point
   * - Which mesh styles does HydroModPy support?
     - :doc:`../solvers`
   * - When should I prefer structured over unstructured?
     - :doc:`../../theory/solvers/mesh-quality-and-acceptance-criteria`
   * - Which mesh diagnostics matter before any physics?
     - :doc:`../concepts/reading-results-pages`

Mesh-Only Minimal Shape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When iterating on refinement policy, geology constraints, or river-network
conformity without invoking any flow solver, declare a single mesh build
through a ``simulation`` workflow with one mesh process (the testbed wraps
several such children when a sweep is needed):

.. code-block:: toml

   [workflow]
   mode = "simulation"

   [workspace]
   project_root = "./my_basin"

   [geographic]

   [geographic.catchment]
   catch_def = "from_polyg_shp"
   dem_init_path = "data/regional_dem.tif"
   polyg_shp_path = "data/basin.shp"
   buff_area = "500 m"

   [[simulation.process]]
   id = "mesh_main"
   type = "mesh"
   backend = "catchment"

   [mesh_catchment]
   constraints_mode = "geology_rivers"

   [mesh_catchment.geology]
   path = "data/geology.shp"

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run mesh_only.toml

Output Files
------------

A testbed writes:

- ``testbed_plan.json``: planned cases and generated child configs;
- ``testbed_cases.csv``: one row per case with status and artifacts;
- ``testbed_metrics.csv``: configured metrics, or flattened numeric summary
  values when no metrics are declared;
- ``testbed_manifest.json``: machine-readable run manifest;
- ``testbed_report.md``: compact human-readable summary.

.. figure:: /_static/workflows/testbed/testbed_outputs.svg
   :alt: Testbed evidence output tree
   :align: center

   A testbed output folder is designed to be read as evidence: generated
   child configs first, then status, metrics, manifest, and report.

Reading The Evidence
--------------------

Use this order when reviewing a testbed run:

1. Open ``_generated_configs/`` to verify what each child actually received
   after base-config loading and overlay merging.
2. Read ``testbed_cases.csv`` to check which cases were planned, skipped,
   completed, or failed.
3. Read ``testbed_metrics.csv`` to compare the declared indicators across
   cases.
4. Read ``testbed_manifest.json`` when another tool needs the full
   machine-readable contract.
5. Read ``testbed_report.md`` for the compact human summary.

This order matters because metrics only make sense after confirming that the
generated child configs isolate the intended method axis.

Dry Planning
------------

Set ``execute = false`` to materialize the child configs without running them:

.. code-block:: toml

   [testbed]
   id = "mesh_resolution_plan"
   execute = false

This is useful when checking that overlays really isolate the intended method
axis before spending runtime on the cases.

Vocabulary
----------

The canonical terms are:

- ``testbed``: reproducible evidence layer;
- ``subject``: method domain under test, currently ``mesh``, ``flow``, or
  ``transport``;
- ``axis``: dimension varied by a case, such as ``resolution`` or
  ``constraints``;
- ``case``: one concrete child execution;
- ``runner``: child launcher used to execute a case;
- ``metric``: value extracted from the child summary.

Current Limits
--------------

The current implementation deliberately supports only:

- ``subject = "mesh"`` with ``runner.type = "simulation"``;
- ``subject = "flow"`` with ``runner.type = "simulation"``;
- ``subject = "flow"`` with ``runner.type = "comparison"``;
- ``subject = "transport"`` with ``runner.type = "simulation"`` or
  ``runner.type = "comparison"``;
- sequential execution.

This is intentional. The workflow establishes the orchestration contract while
keeping future transport runners as separate extensions.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The code is intentionally split into two small modules:

- ``hydromodpy.analysis.testbed.config`` validates the TOML contract, supported
  subject/runner pairs, cases, metrics, and path resolution;
- ``hydromodpy.analysis.testbed.runtime`` materializes child TOMLs, delegates
  execution, extracts metrics, and writes evidence files.

Adding a new subject should extend that contract rather than special-case the
runner in user configuration. In practice, a new subject needs:

- a subject name and allowed runner pair;
- a mapping from runner to generated child workflow;
- a runner branch in the launcher;
- tests for dry planning, execution, and metric extraction;
- a small documented example.

The testbed layer should remain a thin evidence layer. Solver-specific logic
belongs in child runners or result stores; the testbed can consume their
summaries, but should not duplicate their physics.
