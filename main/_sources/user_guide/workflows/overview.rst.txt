Overview Workflow
=================

``[workflow].mode = "overview"`` builds a watershed identity card. It runs the
geographic and data-loading parts of HydroModPy without running a groundwater
solver.

Use it when the first question is:
"What basin am I modelling, what data are available, and does the spatial
support look coherent?"

Functional Role
---------------

The overview workflow is a pre-solver inspection workflow. It is designed to:

- delineate or load the watershed geometry;
- build the domain and support context;
- load declared observation and input-data families;
- render maps, station inventories, and time-series panels;
- populate the workspace cache so later workflows can reuse data.

It is not designed to:

- execute MODFLOW or Boussinesq;
- calibrate parameters;
- compare solver outputs;
- make numerical-method claims.

Typical Command
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   hmp run examples/projects/04_data_overview/project.toml

Reference examples:

- ``examples/projects/04_data_overview/project.toml``
- ``examples/projects/05_nancon_data_overview/config_overview.toml``
- ``examples/projects/02_nancon_watershed/run_overview_all_apis.toml``

Representative Results
----------------------

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_watershed_dem.png
   :alt: DEM-oriented overview result for the overview workflow
   :width: 100%

   A correct overview run should first produce a convincing DEM-oriented
   watershed framing.

.. gallery-figure:: /_static/capability_gallery/geographic/geographic_watershed_local.png
   :alt: Local watershed overview result for the overview workflow
   :width: 100%

   The local figure then confirms which basin overlays and loaded data layers
   are actually available before moving on to meshing or solving.

Data Families And Representations
---------------------------------

The overview workflow is not only a map generator. It is the place where
HydroModPy makes heterogeneous input data visible before they become modelling
assumptions. A single report can combine local files, cached workspace assets,
and API-backed sources, but each family should be represented in the form that
best exposes its modelling role.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 28 28 20

   * - Family
     - Typical sources
     - Report representation
     - What it validates
   * - Terrain and watershed support
     - DEM rasters, outlet coordinates, precomputed watershed polygons.
     - DEM map, watershed boundary, outlet marker, derived slope or extent
       summary.
     - CRS consistency, outlet snapping, catchment scale, and the spatial
       support used by later workflows.
   * - Hydrography and drainage network
     - Local river layers, national hydrographic APIs, workspace-cached network
       extracts.
     - River overlay, stream ordering, station-to-network context, optional
       buffered constraints.
     - Whether the drainage network is spatially coherent with the watershed
       and usable for mesh constraints or boundary diagnostics.
   * - Geology, zones, and domain masks
     - Geological polygons, interpreted hydrogeological zones, manual masks.
     - Zone map, polygon inventory, area shares, conflict warnings.
     - Whether heterogeneity should enter the support, the mesh, calibration
       parameters, or only remain contextual.
   * - Observation stations
     - Hydrometry, piezometry, intermittency, water-quality inventories from
       APIs or local station tables.
     - Station inventory table, map markers, distance-to-network checks,
       coverage counts.
     - Which observations are actually inside or near the model domain and
       which stations should be excluded before calibration.
   * - Time-series observations
     - Discharge, head, intermittency state, chemistry, or other measured
       chronicles.
     - Time-series panels, availability bars, missing-data summaries,
       observation-window statistics.
     - Whether the requested date window has enough information for transient
       simulation, comparison, or calibration.
   * - Forcing and boundary context
     - Meteorology, recharge proxies, sea level, imposed hydraulic heads,
       upstream/downstream conditions.
     - Forcing summaries, cumulative curves, date coverage checks, boundary
       context panels.
     - Whether forcing chronology and boundary assumptions are compatible with
       the intended simulation period.
   * - Derived or interpreted products
     - Cached transformations, inferred recharge, simplified zones, cleaned
       station selections.
     - Provenance cards, derived-layer overlays, before/after inventories.
     - Which modelling choices were computed by HydroModPy rather than supplied
       directly by an external source.

Source Modes
------------

The same conceptual family can enter the workspace through several routes.
The overview report should make that route explicit because it changes how the
result is audited.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 36 40

   * - Source mode
     - Typical use
     - Practical consequence
   * - Local file
     - Stable DEM, shapefile, GeoPackage, CSV, NetCDF, or Zarr input owned by
       the study.
     - The report mainly checks projection, extent, schema, and temporal
       coverage. Reproducibility depends on keeping the file under the project
       or workspace convention.
   * - API-backed download
     - Hydrometric stations, public hydrography, meteorological or piezometric
       services.
     - The report should expose date of access, query extent, station counts,
       and missing responses. Cache the result before using it in a calibrated
       or published run.
   * - Workspace cache
     - Previously downloaded or normalized assets reused across several
       workflows.
     - The report verifies that later simulations read the same data object,
       not a silently refreshed API response.
   * - Generated product
     - Watershed delineation, cleaned station selection, derived forcing,
       support masks, or mesh-preparation layers.
     - The report must show provenance and enough visual evidence to decide
       whether the derived product can become part of a solver workflow.

Important Parameters
--------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 28 32 40

   * - Section / field
     - Role
     - Practical guidance
   * - ``workflow``
     - Selects the overview launcher.
     - Must be exactly ``"overview"`` for ``hmp run`` dispatch.
   * - ``[workspace]``
     - Resolves where cache and outputs live.
     - Keep one stable workspace while iterating on data choices.
   * - ``[geographic.catchment]``
     - Defines catchment extraction or loading.
     - ``catch_def``, outlet coordinates, DEM path, CRS, snap distance, and
       buffer are the first parameters to inspect.
   * - ``[domain]``
     - Defines the model support and depth model.
     - Use it to decide whether geology or zones are part of the spatial
       support even before solving.
   * - ``[data].types``
     - Declares data families to load.
     - Start with support-defining layers, then add station inventories,
       observation time series, forcing, and boundary-context sources as the
       question becomes more specific.
   * - ``[overview]``
     - Names and dates the report.
     - Match the date range to the observation families you request.
   * - ``[overview.panels]``
     - Enables or disables report panels.
     - Turn off panels for missing or irrelevant data instead of forcing every
       source to exist.

Panel Controls
--------------

``[overview.panels]`` controls the generated identity-card sections:

.. code-block:: toml

   [overview.panels]
   map_dem = true
   map_geology = true
   map_hydrography = true
   stats_card = true
   timeseries_discharge = true
   timeseries_piezometry = false
   climatic_summary = false
   timeseries_intermittency = true
   timeseries_water_quality = false
   station_inventory = true

Use panel toggles as documentation intent. For example, disabling
``timeseries_piezometry`` says that this overview does not evaluate
piezometric observations, while keeping the rest of the watershed report
valid.

Outputs To Inspect
------------------

Start with the map panels:

1. DEM and watershed boundary.
2. Hydrography overlay.
3. Geology or support map.
4. Station inventory.
5. Observed time series.

If these panels look wrong, do not continue to ``simulation`` yet. Fix the
catchment, source, CRS, or date-range issue first.
