User Guide
==========

This section groups the operational documentation that sits after the first
quickstart and before the low-level developer/API reference.

Use it when you already know how to launch HydroModPy, but need to understand
which workflow to run, how projects and runs are organized, how to compare
outputs, or where to find the scientific and architecture details behind a
topic.

If this is your first visit, start with :doc:`../getting_started/index`
instead. If you want equations or implementation diagrams, jump directly to
:doc:`../theory/index` or :doc:`../architecture/index`.

      **Configuration reference**
      ^^^
      The TOML-first public API of HydroModPy. Every section validated by
      ``HydroModPyConfig`` with fields, defaults, types, and the JSON
      Schema explorer.

      :link-type: doc

      **Workflow families and driving modes**
      ^^^
      Overview, simulation, testbed, calibration, and comparison workflows
      (with the regional_lab profile for site-catalog campaigns), plus the
      seven driving modes (CLI TOML, JSON, Python, notebooks, and low-level
      primitives).

      :link: concepts/workspace-layout
      :link-type: doc

      **Workspace layout**
      ^^^
      Where HydroModPy stores inputs, caches, generated artifacts, runs, and
      reports.

   .. grid-item-card::
      :class-card: sd-shadow-sm sd-rounded-3 sd-p-4
      :link: concepts/project-vs-run
      :link-type: doc

      **Project vs run**
      ^^^
      The distinction between reusable project state and one persisted model
      execution.

Workspace-first organization
----------------------------

The cleanest long-term organization is to use the workspace layout as the
backbone, then describe workflows as operations that populate parts of that
workspace.

Read the documentation in this order when you want to avoid duplicates:

1. :doc:`concepts/workspace-layout` explains the durable folders:
   data cache, project TOMLs, generated child configs, runs, outputs, reports,
   and gallery evidence.
2. :doc:`workflows/index` explains which operation writes to those folders:
   overview for data identity cards, simulation for one persisted run, testbed
   for controlled variants (including regional_lab profile campaigns),
   calibration for repeated candidate runs, and comparison for shared-case
   solver contrasts.
3. Topic guides such as :doc:`workflows/testbed`,
   :doc:`workflows/comparison`, and :doc:`workflows/calibration` are the
   single source of truth for each workflow family. They link out to
   theory, gallery, and architecture rather than re-describing the
   workflow walkthroughs.
4. The capability gallery should remain the evidence layer: stable figures,
   metrics, and reproducible examples that illustrate the workspace artifacts.

This structure keeps ``workspace layout`` as the index of where things live,
``workflow`` pages as the index of what operation creates them, and topic
pages as cross-cutting reading maps.

Reading outputs
---------------

Use these pages once you have generated or opened result pages:

- :doc:`concepts/reading-results-pages` explains how to read gallery,
  comparison, and validation pages.
- :doc:`concepts/comparison-output-reading-order` gives the reading
  order for comparison artifacts.
