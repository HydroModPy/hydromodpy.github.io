Per-Package Reference
=====================

One focused page per top-level subpackage of ``hydromodpy/``. Each
page covers:

- the package role (what question it answers);
- the sub-modules and their responsibilities;
- the key public symbols a contributor needs to know;
- the recommended reading path inside the code;
- the layer-matrix neighbours and the documented tolerances.

For high-level questions (mental model, layer matrix, design
patterns), see :doc:`/architecture/index` and the foundation pages
listed there.

For prescriptive questions ("how do I add X"), see
:doc:`../how-to/index`.
