Architecture and Developer Guide
================================

.. raw:: html

   <p class="lead">
   The developer-facing reference for HydroModPy. Documents the package
   architecture, design patterns, storage layout, test layers, and the
   contributor recipes for extending the toolbox.
   </p>

For user-facing documentation, see :doc:`/user_guide/index`. For
scientific notes and equations, see :doc:`/theory/index`.
